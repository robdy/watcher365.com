When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.",

The ‘edit in’ option for Excel will be available for Copilot responses that are formatted in a table, and will automatically open an Excel file with the formatted response added. Copilot responses can only be exported if the meeting policy for the meeting is set to allow copying or forwarding of meeting chat, live captions, transcript, and Copilot responses. The export capability will also inherit the sensitivity label of the meeting (sensitivity labels are available to Teams Premium users).",

Keyword logic update for email - An email will be excluded from scoring only when all the attachments match the keyword exclusions or email subject matches the keyword exclusions. This will be helpful to reduce the email signature noise which commonly contains keyword \"image\".\n2. Keyword exclusions on both target and source file paths - For signals like file copied to removable media, keyword exclusions apply on both target and source file paths.\n3. File path exclusions for removable media - We will start supporting file path exclusions for removable media.\n4. Exclusion support for browser - Domain exclusions are now supported for browsing indicators.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",

This will help them formulate the right response action, like escalating the Incident to SOC teams for quick remediation, etc. \n\nMicrosoft Entra offers two types of compromised user detections.\n1. Sign in risk detections: compromise risk associated with a specific sign-in.\n2. User risk detections: compromise risk associated with a specific user.\n\nInsider risk management admins can opt into each of the above risk detections from Insider risk management global settings. Risk detections will be available in the indicator timeline within the alert investigation experience. Risk detections will not impact the risk score or severity of Insider risk management alerts.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.  <br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks",

      "description": "This feature introduces SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented) user setting in the Walkie Talkie app. This feature is designed to manage the Bluetooth headset connection to optimize battery life. When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.",

Keyword exclusions on both target and source file paths - For signals like file copied to removable media, keyword exclusions apply on both target and source file paths.\n3. File path exclusions for removable media - We will start supporting file path exclusions for removable media.\n4. Exclusion support for browser - Domain exclusions are now supported for browsing indicators.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

Previously, Python in Excel was exclusive to users with paid Microsoft 365 commercial licenses that provided access to the Microsoft 365 desktop apps, such as Office 365 E3 and E5 licenses. As a part of this feature, users with access to Excel will be able to add Python formulas directly into their workbooks without any installation required. These Python formulas will be run by Excel in a secure container on the Microsoft Cloud with enterprise-level security as a compliant Microsoft 365 connected experience.",
