      "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Communication Compliance - Empower end users to report inappropriate posts and comments in Viva Engage",
      "description": "Microsoft Viva Engage users are empowered to report inappropriate or concerning posts and comments within Viva Engage conversations. These reported posts are then submitted to a Communication Compliance policy for designated investigators with the appropriate role-based access control permissions to review and take action if deemed necessary. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. Note: We have updated the release phase to the reflect current state.  Additionally, this began rolling out to GA in December 2023 and did not release to Preview.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.",
