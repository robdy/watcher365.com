Second, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator will be able to change the spoken language. Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript > Language settings > Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.",

User analytics will cover all eligible users in the tenant including users not in the scope of any Insider risk management policy. During the initial rollout, user analytics will be enabled by default for all customers who have enabled Insider risk management analytics. This will help customers benefit from this additional intelligence right from the start. Customers can enable/disable user analytics in your tenant from Insider risk management Global settings. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",

When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.",

Existing analysts accessing IRM data in purview will continue to access IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR. IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR does not honor anonymization. This is to enable effective correlation of IRM alerts with alerts from other solutions in Microsoft Defender XDR platform (such as Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Cloud apps, etc.). Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

Second, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator will be able to change the spoken language. Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript > Language settings > Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.",

      "description": "This feature introduces SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented) user setting in the Walkie Talkie app. This feature is designed to manage the Bluetooth headset connection to optimize battery life. When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.",
