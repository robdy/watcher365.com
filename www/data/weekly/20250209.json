We are making no changes to the functionality of any setting and all settings will remain on the same page as they are today but will be behind clickable sections. The first is introducing quick access to the most used actions on the landing page of Edge Settings. Second, each densely populated page—Privacy, search, and services; Appearance; Cookies and site permissions; System and performance—will feature quick access to its most used actions. Third, for these same pages, each section will now click-through to its respective sub-settings (similar to a table of contents).",

User risk detections - Compromise risk associated with a specific user. - Insider risk management admins can opt into each of the above risk detections from Insider risk management global settings. - Risk detections will be available in the indicator timeline within the alert investigation experience. - Risk detections will not impact the risk score or severity of Insider risk management alerts. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file",

This will help them formulate the right response action, like escalating the Incident to SOC teams for quick remediation, etc. Microsoft Entra offers two types of compromised user detections: 1. Sign in risk detections - Compromise risk associated with a specific sign-in. 2. User risk detections - Compromise risk associated with a specific user. - Insider risk management admins can opt into each of the above risk detections from Insider risk management global settings. - Risk detections will be available in the indicator timeline within the alert investigation experience. - Risk detections will not impact the risk score or severity of Insider risk management alerts. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks",

First, when transcription, recording, or Copilot are enabled before or during the meeting, users will be prompted to select the spoken language to ensure transcription accuracy. Second, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator will be able to change the spoken language. Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript > Language settings > Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file",
