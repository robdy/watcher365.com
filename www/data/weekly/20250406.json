This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won't remove any existing holds and won't allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.",

      "description": "The Purview eDiscovery team has increased the limits for Hold policies for eDiscovery Premium in the new purview.microsoft.com portal. \n\nThe maximum number of mailboxes in a single case hold has been increased from 1,000 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won't remove any existing holds and won't allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.",

Keyword exclusions on both target and source file paths - For signals like file copied to removable media, keyword exclusions apply on both target and source file paths. 3.

Second, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator will be able to change the spoken language. Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript > Language settings > Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.",

This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won't remove any existing holds and won't allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file",
