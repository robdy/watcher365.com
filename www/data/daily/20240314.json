Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies.

Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies.
