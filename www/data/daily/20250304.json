This, along with meeting transcript and meeting chat, enables users to ask Copilot to summarize or find specific information from screen-shared content (e.g., ‘Which products had the highest sales?’), consolidate insights across both the conversation and presentation (e.g., 'What was the feedback per slide?'), and draft new content based on the entire meeting (e.g., 'Rewrite the paragraph shared on the screen incorporating the feedback from the chat’). This works for any content shared while sharing your desktop screen (including but not limited to documents, slides, spreadsheets, and websites, irrespective of platform or app). Support for PowerPoint Live and Whiteboard in Teams will be available at a later date.",

This not only simplifies labeling in bulk across document libraries in an organization but enriches DLP and Copilot with signal to allow admins to monitor and restrict access to this content. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library. Changes to user permissions on the document library are reflected on downloaded files, including full revocation for users removed from the document library. This provides a more centralized information worker-managed permission model that also offers revocation capabilities at a user level, rather than per-document.",

Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library. Changes to user permissions on the document library are reflected on downloaded files, including full revocation for users removed from the document library. This provides a more centralized information worker-managed permission model that also offers revocation capabilities at a user level, rather than per-document.",
