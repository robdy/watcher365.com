      "description": "To make finding browser settings more efficient, Microsoft Edge is introducing three navigation improvements to Edge Settings. We are making no changes to the functionality of any setting and all settings will remain on the same page as they are today but will be behind clickable sections. The first is introducing quick access to the most used actions on the landing page of Edge Settings. Second, each densely populated page—Privacy, search, and services; Appearance; Cookies and site permissions; System and performance—will feature quick access to its most used actions. Third, for these same pages, each section will now click-through to its respective sub-settings (similar to a table of contents).",

This simplifies labeling in bulk across document libraries in an organization. This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the online copy of the document. Changes to user permissions on the online copy of the document are reflected on downloaded copy, including full access removal. This provides a more streamlined way to revoke access to documents for individual users, versus revoking access on a per-document basis.",
