Starting April 2025, a Viva Engage premium licensed user will be able to create an article or a question post type directly by clicking on the \"Create new\" button, easing the process of creation of these post types, while also helping users discover them quicker. Kindly note that this roll out does not entail adding new types of content creation, but brings forth a unified and easier way to create these post types when a user is already licensed to use them.\nBy 'Viva Engage premium licensed user', we mean this feature is available for users licensed to the Microsoft Viva Suite or the Microsoft Viva Employee Communications and Communities Suite.",
