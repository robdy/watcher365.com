  "description": ",The Software updates page gives admins and business decision makers a high-level overview of the software update status for Office devices in the organization. Future iterations of the page will include more products from the Microsoft 365 suite. The Data Lake utilized for Education Insights Premium, which stores external data from Student Information Systems (SIS), School Data Sync (SDS), and Microsoft 365 Activity Data, can now be shared and copied to the customer's own Azure Data Lake. This allows a customer to leverage all the data meant for Insights Premium for their own data exploration, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) purposes.",
