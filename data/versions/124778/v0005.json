    "newValue": "The \"Start scoring activity for users\" feature will move from the Users page to the Policies page. Admins can use “Start scoring activity for users” on the Policies tab to manually add a user (or users) to one or more insider risk policies for a specific amount of time, to start assigning risk scores to their activity without a detected indicator. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy."
