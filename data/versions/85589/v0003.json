    "newValue": ",You can set up a connector in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to import human resources (HR) related events such as a user's resignation or a change in a user's job level. This information can be used by the Insider Risk Management solution to bring users under scope of data theft/leak policies and enrich risk insights. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, security and policy violations, and more. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. <br>Preview date: December CY2021"
