  "description": ",We are combining the best of Microsoft Teams templates with\nSharePoint site templates – into the same flow of creation. When we create a\nnew team using a default template – for example the “Manage a Project”\ntemplate, the project management channels and apps, and the connected\nSharePoint template gets applied automatically. Critically, the pages, lists,\nand Power Platform integrations are pinned as tabs in Teams automatically, and\nbest of all these pages and lists are fully editable right in Teams.",
