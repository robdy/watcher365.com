  "description": "This feature brings a new way for users to create posts, communities etc. through a centralized creation button in Viva Engage. Currently, Engage users need to go to different locations in the application for different creation types - a post, community, etc. Starting in October 2024, a Viva Engage user will be able to create the different types of content already enabled for them, using a centralized creation button. This new feature eases the process of creation and helps users quickly discover the various creation options they are licensed to use.",
