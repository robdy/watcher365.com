  "description": ",[Updated April 20, 2023: We will not be rolling this feature to customers in GCC at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. Thank you for your patience.] Collaborative notes allow meeting attendees to co-create and collaborate on their meeting agenda, notes, and action items.  Since Collaborative notes are a Loop component, it is always in sync regardless of how many places they live in.  Assigned Tasks in Collaborative notes automatically sync with ToDo & Planner.",
