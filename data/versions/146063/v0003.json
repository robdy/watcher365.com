  "description": "To support\naccessibility best practices, we’ve made some improvements to the Page\nauthoring experience. 1 - Added\n     functionality to mark images as decorative. Decorative images will be\n     ignored by assistive technology, including screen readers. This addition\n     has been made to the following: background image of the Title Region,\n     images added inline with the Text Web Part, Image Web Part, Image Gallery,\n     Hero, Call to Action, and Quick Links. 2 - Changed\n     the heading level 1 to be reserved for the page title in the title area.\n     Headings can still be added to a page at levels 2-4 using the web parts.\n     This makes it easier for users of screen readers to understand how your\n     page is structured.",
