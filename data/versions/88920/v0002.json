  "description": ",Expanding optical character recognition beyond text extracted from images or PDFs to include handwritten and printed text, which will then be evaluated against the customers policy conditions (such as keywords matches for threatening language), further reducing an organizations policy violation risk. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance helps organizations detect explicit code of conduct and regulatory compliance violations, such as harassing or threatening language, sharing of adult content, and inappropriate sharing of sensitive information. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are explicitly opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.    <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance?view=o365-worldwide",
