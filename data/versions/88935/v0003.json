This enables admins to include more advanced classification techniques, such as exact data match and named entities, into data loss prevention policies. Admins will also have the flexibility to set a per-device bandwidth limit for a 24-hour period to regulate bandwidth usage. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/endpoint-dlp-using?view=o365-worldwide#advanced-classification-scanning-and-protection<br>GA date: April CY2022"
