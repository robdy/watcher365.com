  "description": "Support for Content camera on new Teams app experience for Windows and Mac. Content camera enables remote attendees to get a clear view of physical objects like whiteboards, printed documents, books, and more that are in a meeting room. Content camera intelligently detects, crops and frames the in-room object and shares its content with remote meeting participants. Even when a presenter moves in front of it, for example the whiteboard, remote participants will be able to see the content right through them.",
