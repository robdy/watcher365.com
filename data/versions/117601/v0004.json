  "description": "This update introduces various improvements to the alert triage experience to accelerate time to action, including the ability to further drill into detected sequences within activity explorer, new alert filtering capabilities, and an enhanced user activity timeline view with a richer alert history. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
