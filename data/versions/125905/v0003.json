  "description": "In order to save space on the message list in Outlook,\nwe are making a UI update: From \"selection circles on the left side of\neach row\" to a \"Select mode that you have to get into before\ncheckboxes appear\". This affects users who don't have \"Sender\nImages\" enabled in the Message List. If you have \"Sender Images\"\nturned on, hovering over the images will still show the checkboxes, even if you\ndid not get yourself into \"Select Mode\". To review if you have\n\"Send image\" enabled, go to Settings/Mail/Layout and scroll to\n\"Sender image\".",
