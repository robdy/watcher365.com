  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Communication Compliance - Detect prompt injection attacks and mentions of protected materials in GenAI prompts and responses?",
  "description": "In Communication Compliance, we're introducing the ability to detect potentially risky Generative AI interactions using Azure Content Safety's Prompt shields and Protected materials classifiers. Detect risk of jailbreak prompt exploitation by malicious users and identify if GenAI responses contain branded/copyrighted material so organizations can maintain content originality and protect their reputations.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
