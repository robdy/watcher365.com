  "description": "When it comes to how links to cloud-hosted Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files should open, you may prefer they open in a browser, desktop apps, or directly in Teams. Now, your Teams file open preference will extend to across Microsoft 365 apps starting with classic Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. This makes the open file experience consistent on your Windows PC/device. If you prefer, you will still be able to choose your Teams file open preference separately.",
