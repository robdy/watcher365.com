  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Improvements to the transcription experience in meetings",
  "description": "We’re making improvements to enhance the transcription experience in meetings. First, when transcription, recording, or Copilot are enabled before or during the meeting, users will be prompted to select the spoken language to ensure transcription accuracy. Second, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator will be able to change the spoken language. Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript > Language settings > Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.",
