  "description": ",<div>Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance policies can be configured to analyze Microsoft Teams meeting transcripts for potential policy matches. Teams meeting transcripts are only generated when meeting organizers opt in to meeting recording. Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA) and business conduct violations, such as inappropriate sharing of sensitive/confidential information, adult content, and using harassing or threatening language. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. Note: We are adjusting the roadmap release phase and adding additional cloud instances to reflect the current state. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. </div>",
