This feature will respect any OneDrive/Sharepoint sharing settings your tenant has enabled. Additionally, if your tenant has Business to Business Invitation Manager (B2B IM) enabled, this feature will allow you to send a whiteboard via PSL to external users and B2B IM will create a guest user account for them so they can access the file.",
