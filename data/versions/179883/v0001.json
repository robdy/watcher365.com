    "newValue": ",With this new\nfeature, user activities that could potentially result in data security\nincidents will be assessed more frequently within a 24-hour period compared\nwith the current practice of once every 24 hours. Alert insights will now be\nupdated every few hours with this increased frequency, providing designated\nanalysts with timely alerts and continuously evolving insights. Microsoft\nPurview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify\npotential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data\nleakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to\ncreate policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and\norganizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are\npseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in\nplace to help ensure user-level privacy."
