  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Native Bluetooth call controls over Hands-Free Protocol for multiple peripheral devices",
  "description": "When you have several peripheral devices connected to Teams, the one you use to answer a call will temporarily become the main device that will be syncing with Teams when using its buttons. After the call, the original device selected in Teams settings will take over again. You can now use multiple native Bluetooth devices and be confident that call controls will function correctly with all of them.",
