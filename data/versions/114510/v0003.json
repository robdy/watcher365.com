    "newValue": "OneDrive plans to make a change to the settings pane for the PC folder backup feature (sometime called Known Folder Move). This settings pane is found by going to OneDrive icon in the system tray then selecting Settings- Sync and backup- Manage backup. The change will introduce toggle buttons to the settings pane along with information showing how much storage, of an end users total storage allotment, will be used by the feature. There is no change to the PC folder backup feature itself which, when enabled, automatically syncs your end userâ€™s Desktop, Documents and Pictures folders on their Windows PC to their OneDrive. <br>GA date: January CY2023"
