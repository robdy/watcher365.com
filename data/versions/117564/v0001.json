Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) is a feature that allows your users to complete multi-factor authentication for their work or school account using the Outlook app on their iOS or Android device.   We always recommend having users download Authenticator to complete their sign-ins, where we can offer the most up-to-date security features. However, users that have not downloaded the app to their device can now approve authentication requests and receive TOTP codes in Outlook, bringing the security of Authenticator to a convenient location."
