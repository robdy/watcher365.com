  "description": "When you create a new view for your list, you can now choose between month view or the new week view to visualize your list information in a way that works best for you. And you can create multiple calendar views - using both month and week - you choose. Once in the calendar view, it's easy to drag-n-drop items to reschedule them (adjusting their date on the list itself).<br>GA date: January CY2023",
