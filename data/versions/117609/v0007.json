  "description": "<div>During an alert investigation, analysts usually use various filters and columns in activity explorer to understand the risk activities that may lead to potential data security incidents. With this update, an Insider Risk Management analyst can quickly use a previously configured combination of filters and columns with one click. This can help analysts efficiently work through recurring activities without manually setting up filters every time. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. </div>",
