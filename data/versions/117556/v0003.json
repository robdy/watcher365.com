  "description": "People centric search is a pattern that lets you zoom in on a person to view, explore, and search the enterprise graph around them. This has the dual purpose of enabling you to find content through people, and to understand people through their content. When you pick a person, you will be able to search through their work; however this will only include items that you already have permissions to view or modify.",
