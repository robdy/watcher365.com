  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Communication Compliance - Detect Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 interactions template",
  "description": "Communication Compliance is introducing a new template dedicated to analyzing all Copilot for Microsoft 365 prompts and response to help ensure content prohibited by customers’ policies, such as harassing or threatening language, is not being used in Copilot for Microsoft 365 interfaces. This scales Communication Compliance’s reach, consistent with Microsoft 365’s expanding interfaces. In addition, administrators are also able to select Copilot chats as a checked location in the policy creation wizard for any new or existing policies. This empowers administrators to fine-tune their management strategy precisely to their organization’s needs, with a focus on user privacy protection. Whether it's setting specific conditions or deploying trainable classifiers, this feature provides flexibility and adaptability in compliance management, ensuring your organization's communications remain secure, compliant, and respectful of user privacy.",
