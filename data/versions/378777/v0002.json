  "description": "We're thrilled to bring you an enhanced folder creation experience! In this update, we've introduced a more intuitive way to manage your folders and accounts. Starting soon, the creation links will be removed, streamlining your interface for a cleaner and more efficient workspace. What's New: A new ellipsis icon will appear in your left nav bar when hovering the folders and accounts for a quick and easy way to create folders, subfolders or execute the existing folder and account actions ensuring a smoother workflow. As part of this update, we'll be removing creation links to provide a more focused and user-friendly experience. Rest assured, the traditional right-click method will still be available for your convenience. #newoutlookforwindows",
