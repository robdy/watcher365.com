  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Communication Compliance - Enhanced investigation and remediation experience (U.S. Government clouds)",
  "description": "Introducing enhancements to the investigation and remediation workflows to help designated investigators facilitate quicker and better-informed actions on policy matches. Enhancements will be available to designated Communication Compliance admins and investigators with the appropriate role-based access control permissions, and include bulk policy exports, interactive how-to demos, and additional context around policy settings and keywords/conditions flagged in a policy. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
