  "description": "With this update, admins with appropriate permissions will have the ability to view a sensitivity analysis, which shows the  count of users in the organization that would meet specific indicator thresholds. The sensitivity analysis is presented as a bar chart, with potential inputs of an indicator threshold on the x-axis and the corresponding count of users on the y-axis. Admins can utilize this chart to make informed decisions on which threshold to apply for each indicator. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
