    "newValue": "We will soon release a completely rebuilt Stream mobile app for iOS and Android. The rebuilt app will give you seamless access to Stream (Classic) and Stream (on SharePoint) videos as well as Teams meeting recordings. The app will also provide an enhanced video playback experience as well as an improved user interface. If your users currently have the Stream mobile app installed on phones or tablets, they will automatically receive the app update when it becomes available. Note: The general release of the rebuilt Stream mobile app will lack certain features that may be critical to some users, such as video recording, uploading and offline downloads. As we continue to build out the revamped mobile app, we expect to add these features in 2023.  <br>GA date: October CY2022"
