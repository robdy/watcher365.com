  "description": "Weâ€™ve introduced a new \"None\" color category for Mail and Calendar in the New Outlook for Windows and Web. This update provides more flexibility and customization in categorizing your emails and calendar events. By selecting the \"None\" option, users can now choose to have items without a designated color, allowing for cleaner organization and more control over which items stand out visually. Updated February 6, 2025: This item was changed to \"Launched\" by mistake. The correct status is currently \"Rolling out.\" #newoutlookforwindows",
