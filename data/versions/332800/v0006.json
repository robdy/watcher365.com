  "description": "Introducing a new control for IT administrators to restrict permissions for the download of meeting transcript files (stored in OneDrive for Business) for any users within the tenant. This policy applies to new meeting transcripts across the entire organization. Administrators can exempt people who are members of specified security groups from the policy. This allows admins to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting transcripts. Note: We have updated the description to provide greater clarity.",
