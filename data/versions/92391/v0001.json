    "newValue": ",When multiple people join a meeting in the same\nroom then a feedback loop is created which causes echo and in most cases the\necho quickly escalates to howling (like when a musician holds the mic too close\nto a loudspeaker). If multiple users on laptops join from the same location, we\nshare with the user that another Teams Device is detected in the vicinity and\nis already joined with audio to the current meeting. We will automatically mute\nthe mic and speakers of the person who has joined post a user who has joined\nwith audio on. <br>GA date: March CY2023<br>Preview date: February CY2023"
