  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Updates to Gallery View in Teams Meetings",
  "description": "<div><span style=\"\">The updated Gallery View places everyone in tiles of equal size by default (16:9 ratio) whether their video is on or off. Users can also easily change their gallery size, choose to prioritize tiles with video-on, and remove their tile from the main gallery. When a Microsoft Teams Room joins the meeting, video is optimized by enlarging the size by default and users can re-size via the contextual menu. Available only in the new Microsoft Teams experience.</span> </div>",
