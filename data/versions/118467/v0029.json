    "oldValue": "The new gallery eases the transition from video on to video off and places everybody in a 16:9 ratio. Users can also change their gallery size by choosing one of the predefined options. Users can choose to go back to this view through the view switcher as desired. Available only in the new Microsoft Teams experience.",
    "newValue": "The updated Gallery View places everyone in tiles of equal size by default (16:9 ratio) whether their video is on or off. Users can also easily change their gallery size, choose to prioritize tiles with video-on, and remove their tile from the main gallery. When a Microsoft Teams Room joins the meeting, video is optimized by enlarging the size by default and users can re-size via the contextual menu. Available only in the new Microsoft Teams experience."
