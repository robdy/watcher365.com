  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Microsoft Mesh app on PC supports guest access for events",
  "description": "Mesh events allows for even better collaboration for more people by now supporting guest user attendees into the Mesh PC app. Event organizers can invite guest users outside their organization, providing an opportunity for broader collaboration and networking in Mesh events. Guests can sign in to the Mesh app to join events, participate in discussions, and experience the same interactive features as internal users, all while maintaining secure access control. Guest user creation follows the existing process for tenant guest user creation (outside of Mesh). For this release, guest users would require a Teams Premium license, just like regular tenant attendees, to collaborate within Mesh. Guest access for the Mesh app on Quest and support for anonymous participants will be supported in a future update.",
