  "description": " Intelligent meeting recap supports meetings where multiple languages were spoken, making it easy for you to catch up quickly on the key points discussed. After a meeting where participants spoke different languages, your intelligent meeting recap will automatically be generated in the language you chose during the meeting. After your recap is generated, you can still change the translation language to the language of your choice from the translation drop-down menu on the recap page.",
