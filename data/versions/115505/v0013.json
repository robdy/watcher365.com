With this change, inbound messages from domain & addresses blocked on Tenant Allow/Block List will land in admin quarantine.",
    "newValue": "Today, incoming messages from domains or email addresses blocked by the Tenant Allow/Block List are treated as high-confidence spam (marked with SCL:9), which may not properly protect end users. With this change, messages from these blocked senders will be treated as high-confidence phish, and will be delivered to the admin quarantine."
