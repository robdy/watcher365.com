  "description": "Teams Notes and Loop components are now available in Microsoft 365 GCC High and DoD environments, enabling real-time collaboration in chats and meetings. Loop components allow users to co-author tables, action items, and lists directly in chats, while Collaborative Notes let meeting attendees co-create and collaborate on their meeting agendas, notes, and action items. As Loop components, these features stay up-to-date across all shared locations, and assigned tasks automatically sync with Microsoft To Do and Planner for seamless task management.",
