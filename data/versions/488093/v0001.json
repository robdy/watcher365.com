  "description": "Businesses using Google Workspace for email and calendaring can now enable bidirectional synchronization with Microsoft Teams through the Teams Admin app. This enhanced sync ensures that events created in either platform are seamlessly reflected in both, improving scheduling efficiency and minimizing the risk of missed meetings. With this update, all calendar events—including incoming, outgoing, existing, and new—are fully synchronized. This feature is being rolled out gradually. When rollout is complete, you can sync up to 50,000 users per tenant.",
