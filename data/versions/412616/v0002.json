  "description": "iOS Live Activities integration for Teams meetings on mobile allows users to view the live progress of a meeting at-a-glance from their lock screen. Real-time notifications with Live Activities automatically update in real-time so users can see when the meeting has started, when it’s in progress, whether recording is on, when someone needs to be admitted from the lobby, and when the meeting has ended. Live Activities is for iPhones only (iOS16.1).",
