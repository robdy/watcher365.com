  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management- New scenario based policy templates",
  "description": "We are adding two additional pre-configured quick policy templates for crown jewel protection and email exfiltration for admins that want to deploy scenario specific policy templates with little configurations needed to get started faster. These templates are in addition to the existing data leak and data theft quick policies. All 4 scenario based quick policies can be found in the Policies page> Create Policies. Additional tuning post deployment to meet individual alert volume needs can be expected. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
