  "description": ",Improvements in the message details reporting interface will help make it easier to create and download reports for specific users under scope of a policy, including number of alerts generated and remediation actions taken within a specified date range. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
