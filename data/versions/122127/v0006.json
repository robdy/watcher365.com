  "description": "We are bringing new usability improvements to Together\nMode. Participants in Together Mode will now have name labels attached to their\nvideos. Name labels will also support status icons that indicate microphone,\nactive speaker, spotlight or pin within the meeting. Second, your own video in\nthe gallery will now be removed while Together Mode is active to avoid\nduplication of the self preview. Lastly, Together Mode will now display raised\nhands and reactions within the view.",
