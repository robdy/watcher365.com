  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Copilot in Teams meetings responses can be exported to Word and Excel",
  "description": "Now, certain responses from Copilot in Teams meetings will have an option to ‘edit in’ Word or Excel. The ‘edit in’ option for Word will be available for Copilot responses that are long (more than 1300 characters) and will automatically open a Word document with the response written. The ‘edit in’ option for Excel will be available for Copilot responses that are formatted in a table, and will automatically open an Excel file with the formatted response added. Copilot responses can only be exported if the meeting policy for the meeting is set to allow copying or forwarding of meeting chat, live captions, transcript, and Copilot responses. The export capability will also inherit the sensitivity label of the meeting (sensitivity labels are available to Teams Premium users).",
