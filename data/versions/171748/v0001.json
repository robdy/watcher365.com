  "description": "Admins can now select the HR resignation date as a condition to assign a minor, moderate, or elevated risk level. For example, an admin can configure the minor risk level to be assigned when an HR resignation date is sent via the HR connector. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
