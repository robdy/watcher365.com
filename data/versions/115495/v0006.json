  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - Sequence detection starting with downloads from third-party sites",
  "description": ",Admins can configure the new sequence feature to detect risky user actions that start with downloading from third-party domains, such as box.com or dropbox.com. This can help security teams gain visibility into actions that take place in their multi-cloud environments that may lead to a data security incident. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
