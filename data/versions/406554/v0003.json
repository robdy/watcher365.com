  "description": "Restricted access control (RAC) is a premium security policy that lets admins restrict access to SharePoint and OneDrive resources to a specific set of users configured using Microsoft 365 or Entra Security groups. As part of this change, new capabilities will be added to review the impact of RAC application using insights reports and additional options to configure the policy will be made available. Also, policy enforcement visibility will be extended to Site owners via SharePoint sites.",
