  "description": "Weâ€™re excited to announce a new feature in Outlook that makes it easier to manage emails across multiple accounts. All personal accounts in the new Outlook for Windows can seamlessly move emails between all their personal accounts, streamlining organization and productivity. For work or school users, this feature is controlled by a policy managed by administrators. By enabling this policy, admins can grant their users the ability to move emails between accounts in a way that aligns with organizational needs and policies. #newoutlookforwindows",
