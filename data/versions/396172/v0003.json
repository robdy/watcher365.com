  "description": "Site ownership policy is a one-stop solution to effectively manage ownership needs of all SharePoint sites in your tenant. It helps you to define your organization's ownership criteria and identify sites that are not compliant. You can further notify predefined set of users of your choice to find the next best site owner or admin. You can also choose to automate actions on sites that remain ownerless for more than 3 months to prevent risks of data mismanagement.",
