  "description": ",Sometimes it can be hard to remember the name of a file or exactly when it was shared, but you know who shared it with you. Because of this, we've created an entirely new way to get back to your shared files both internal and external - organized by the people you work with! This view presents the people you have recently collaborated with, along with all the files that have been shared with you by each person.",
