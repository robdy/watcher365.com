A version of DSPM for AI is also available to additional licensing, specifically Microsoft 365 E3 and Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses. The AI hub in Microsoft Purview is a centralized location to gain insights into generative AI activity including the sensitive data flowing in AI prompts - both for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and non-Microsoft AI applications.\n",
