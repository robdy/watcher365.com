  "description": "Copilot for Security in DLP can summarize DLP policies. This enhancement enables DLP admins to gain insights on coverage of policies viz. location, classifiers and notifications, and more. \n \nDLP admins can get these insights on all the policies or on few selected policies. They will be able to use prompts to gain deeper level view of how a policy is configured for their digital landscape. This helps them align their data posture on a regular basis and make corrections to policy posture as needed.",
