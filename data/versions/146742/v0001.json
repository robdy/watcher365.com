    "newValue": ",By combining Communication Compliance classifiers with Azure Active Directory organizational hierarchy data, we are able to detect if offensive/inappropriate communications are occurring in a hierarchical imbalance. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy."
