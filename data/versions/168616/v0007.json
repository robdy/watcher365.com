  "description": "This feature will provide faster page load times when using OneDrive for Web or when using the Files app in Teams irrespective of your network speed. You will see faster screen loading, sorting, filtering, file moving, and renaming. This increase in speed is made possible by storing file metadata in the local cache of your device as opposed to requesting it from the cloud service.",
