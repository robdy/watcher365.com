    "newValue": "Advanced classification scanning and protection allows the Microsoft 365 cloud-based data classification service to scan items, classify them, and return the results to the endpoint device. This enables admins to include more advanced classification techniques, such as exact data match, into data loss prevention policies. Admins will also have the flexibility to set a per-device bandwidth limit for a 24-hour period to regulate bandwidth usage.  <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/endpoint-dlp-using?view=o365-worldwide#advanced-classification-scanning-and-protection<br>GA date: November CY2022"
