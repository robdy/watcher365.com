  "description": ",So much of our collaboration happens in the context of meetings, yet how many times have you found yourself trying to scroll back and find a meeting recording from a month ago? Or spent time digging through email to find pre-reading material for an upcoming meeting so you can be prepared going in?  With this new meetings view in OneDrive, you'll be able to get back to all of your meeting content with just a few clicks! When you come to meetings view, you'll first see any meetings in the next week that you might need to prepare for, followed by a list of meetings that have already occurred.  This view brings together all content shared both in meeting invites, meeting chat, and meeting recordings all into one place for easy access! Here youâ€™ll see a recurring meeting with multiple meeting recordings, all laid out sequentially so you can catch up on whatever you missed.",
