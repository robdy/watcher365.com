  "description": "Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management is introducing sharing Insider Risk Management data with other Microsoft services for Government customers. When turned on, admins with the correct permissions will be able to review user risk details and alerts from Insider Risk Management within other solutions such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Communication Compliance, and Microsoft Defender.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
