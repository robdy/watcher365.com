  "title": "Microsoft Viva: A new reactions look and feel in Viva Engage",
  "description": "Viva Engage will feature a new look and feel for reactions in conversations. Users will see a more interactive style, showing others' reactions as clickable pills across the conversation card. This design brings Engage reactions more in line with other Microsoft 365 products, including Teams. There are no changes to the number of icons available in Engage with this new design. Users will see this change in Engage web and Teams and Outlook apps. Mobile apps and other integrated surfaces will follow.",
