  "title": "Microsoft Viva: Copilot Headlines report in Advanced Insights",
  "description": "Insights analysts and leaders are interested in finding highlights and opportunities in their Copilot adoption data, but it can be time-consuming to find the groups that are experiencing dramatic trends or have much higher or lower Copilot usage than expected. Copilot Headlines shows an analyst where interesting things are happening in their data by automatically scanning a query and looking for outliers, changes over time, and differences from dynamic internal benchmarks. Analysts receive the headlines in a Power BI report as a table, along with supporting visualizations to help explore and validate the results.",
