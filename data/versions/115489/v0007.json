    "newValue": "Connected content will be seamlessly integrated into Microsoft Search mainline search results. This means, the results are shown next to Files, Sites, News, OneDrive for Business and other Microsoft content in the search results. Users can then use pagination to browse through the results, including connected content, or use the LastModified- and FileType-filters to refine their search for connected content. Admins can decide how (interleaved, or Result Cluster) and which connected content will appear in the All-tab. There will be no need any more to map a connection to a custom vertical. <br>GA date: April CY2023"
