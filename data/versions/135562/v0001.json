    "newValue": "The task publishing experience in Microsoft\nTeams is a feature for frontline organizations that have employees distributed\nacross many geographically dispersed locations. The task publishing feature\nallows an organization to centrally define a set of work, choose the set of\nfrontline locations that should complete that work, create the appropriate\ntasks for each frontline location, and monitor how that work is going. One of\nthe top feature requests for task publishing has been the ability to create a\nset of tasks once and set them to automatically repeat at a scheduled cadence.\nCommon examples are daily opening and closing tasks or weekly/monthly site\ninspections and compliance walks. When this feature is available, you'll be\nable to set recurrence on a draft task list, which will allow you to choose the\ncadence (such as every month on the 15th of the month). You can then publish\nthe list and task publishing will take care of scheduling the publication so\nthat the list publishes automatically at that cadence going forward. We know\nfrom a wide range of customer conversations that this will be a big time saver\nfor distributing recurring tasks across frontline organizations."
