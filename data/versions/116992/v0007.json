  "description": "Idle session timeout feature allows IT admins to configure a tenant-wide timeout value based on which users get automatically signed out after a period of inactivity on Microsoft 365 web apps. This feature is an improvement over, and will eventually replace, current idle timeout settings in Outlook Web App (OWA) and SharePoint Online (SPO).  This item is no longer accurate and is being removed from the roadmap.",
