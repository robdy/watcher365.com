The new experience will show files and folders shared across various Microsoft 365 apps so that users can find files shared with them over email, chats, and meetings all in one place. In addition, users can identify updates to files by using the activity column, as well as leverage the new filtering pills to quickly find shared files. <br>GA date: March CY2023"
