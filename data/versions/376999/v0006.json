  "description": "Introducing two new DLP Exchange predicates support for DLP Policy tips and Oversharing popups for E5 users: \"Message contains\" and \"Attachment contains\" with a focus on client-side evaluation on specific email components like email body or attachments only. Unlike the broader \"Content contains\" predicate that evaluated entire email envelope, these enable targeted DLP evaluation on specific email components only and show DLP Policy tips and oversharing popups accordingly in Outlook win32.",
