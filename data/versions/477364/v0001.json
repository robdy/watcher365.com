  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - Increasing policy template limits for Insider Risk Management",
  "description": "Insider Risk Management will increase policy creation limits from 20 policies per template to 100 maximum overall active policies. For example, an organization may have 50 data leak policy templates because the limit will now apply to all active policies versus each policy template. \n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
