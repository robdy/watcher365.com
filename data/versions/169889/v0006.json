  "description": "A new reports page will be available in Insider Risk Management. The three charts available on the alerts page -- including total alerts that need review, average time to resolve alerts, and alerts summary -- will be moving to the new reports page.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
