    "newValue": "We are introducing two new in-product messages that will allow admins to promote the usage of Stream (on SharePoint) within their organization. First, admins will have the option to turn on a small banner message which will appear on the home page of Stream (Classic) to all users. Admins can choose a default message or customize one of their own. The default message states: You're accessing Stream (Classic). To visit the new version of Stream, select the Stream (on SharePoint) button to the right. The default message is localized to all languages. If admins choose to place a custom message, they will need to localize the message to any required languages. Second, when users select \"Upload video\" from Stream (Classic) a message will appear by default that gives users the option to upload their videos to either Stream (Classic) or Stream (on SharePoint). Should your organization wish to opt-out of this default message, you can raise a support ticket with subject line \"Disable upload to Stream (on SharePoint)\". <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/streamnew/new-stream<br>GA date: May CY2022"
