  "description": "The Cloud policy service will begin rolling out for Microsoft 365 GCC customers late June 2024. The Cloud Policy service allows Microsoft 365 administrators to configure policies for Microsoft 365 apps and assign these policies using Microsoft 365 or Entra ID groups. Once configured, these policies are automatically enforced as users sign in and use Microsoft 365 apps. The initial release will support policies for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on Windows and future updates will bring support for additional applications and platforms. For additional information about the Cloud Policy service, refer to Overview of the Cloud Policy service for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/admincenter/overview-office-cloud-policy-service",
