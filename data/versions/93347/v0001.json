Personal query history will show the queries you have previously used. These personal query suggestions are served from your personal search history. Personal query suggestions are a quick way to get back to results you've found before. You just need to remember the beginning of a query, after you've typed just a few characters the query is suggested for you. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/microsoft-search-us-government-environments<br>GA date: August CY2022"
