  "description": "Enables administrators to program Microsoft Teams certified phone devices to directly dial a pre-configured phone number or contact, such as emergency services in a manufacturing plant or help desk in the organization. The hotline can be set up directly through the device settings or the Teams admin center. The device will need to be enabled with a Teams Shared Device License and set to common area phone mode. Note: The launch status was incorrect and has now been changed to reflect the correct state. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.",
