    "newValue": ",Privacy-enabled security and compliance user activity reports allow Insider Risk Management admins with the appropriate permissions to examine risky user actions that may lead to a potential data security incident, such as an employee attempting to download confidential files to a personal device, for specific users across a defined time period without having to assign them to an Insider Risk Management policy. This helps customers maintain scale and flexibility in cyber risk and data security incident management. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/insider-risk-management-activities?view=o365-worldwide#user-activity-reports-preview<br>GA date: October CY2022<br>Preview date: December CY2021"
