  "description": "This policy enables IT admins to block Copilot responses that might infer emotions, make evaluations, discuss personal traits, and use context to deduce answers. When this setting is applied it restricts copilotâ€™s ability to make inferences or evaluations about people or groups when prompted to do so by users. Users cannot disable this setting. The setting applies to Copilot in Teams meetings.",
