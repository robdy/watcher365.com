  "title": "Microsoft 365 app: [Android] Shared Device Mode for Front Line Workers (via OneAuth)",
  "description": ",Frontline workers such as retail associates, flight crew members, and field service workers often use a shared mobile device to do their work. That becomes problematic when they start sharing passwords or pin numbers to access customer and business data on the shared device. Shared device mode allows you to configure an Android device so that it can be easily shared by multiple employees. Employees can sign in and access customer information quickly. When they're finished with their shift or task, they can sign out of the device and it will be immediately ready for the next employee to use. Shared device mode also provides Microsoft identity backed management of the device.  <br>GA date: June CY2023<br>Preview date: January CY2023",
