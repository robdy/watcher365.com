  "description": "With this update, admins with appropriate permissions will be able to delete any of the indicator variants created. Deletion of variants will directly delete it from all the Insider Risk Management policies being used. Any old insights related to the variants will remain for future reference. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
