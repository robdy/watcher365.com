  "description": "Viva Topics provides a central knowledge base\nfor manually created topics and definitions inside apps like Viva Engage.\n These topics don't use Viva Topics' AI, topic cards and pages but can be\nselected to classify conversations and posts in Viva Engage.  With this\nrelease, we're proving a way for knowledge admins to edit, create, and delete\nthese \"simple\" topics without Viva licensing as a way to make\nknowledge management more accessible to more users.",
