  "description": "We're making a change to the shared folder experience in OneDrive. Currently, when a user opens a shared folder in OneDrive, they are taken to a view of that folder within the sharers OneDrive. In the new experience, opening a shared folder will take the user to the shared folder within the People view of their own OneDrive. This view, organized by people, shows and allows access to all the files and folders that have been shared with the user.",
