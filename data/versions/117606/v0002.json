  "description": ",With this update, Insider Risk Management will support the scanning technique of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect potentially risky activities that may lead to data security incidents related to images in SharePoint, Teams messages, and endpoints. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
