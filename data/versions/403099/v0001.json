  "description": "Shortly after a meeting ends, meeting participants will automatically get a set of all the meeting artifacts in the calendar for the new Outlook in Windows and web. Included in this set is a quick entry point to the meeting recap page, the transcript, the recording, and any files that were shared. For users with access to intelligent meeting recap, in addition to the entry point to intelligent recap in Microsoft Teams, users will also see highlights like number of speakers, number of name mentions, and suggested tasks directly within Microsoft Outlook. #newoutlookforwindows",
