Microsoft 365 users with MyAnalytics (Full) service plan or Viva Insights subscription get an unlimited number of inline suggestions for delaying email delivery to their coworkers.   A Global admin or an Exchange Online admin role can configure tenant level settings in the Microsoft admin center. Individuals can also turn schedule send suggestions on or off through their own Settings within the Viva Insights add-in in Outlook or Viva Insights dashboard.",
