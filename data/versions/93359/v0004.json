Currently, what is supported in this field is either the domain from DNS PTR record or /24 IP Subnet. Additionally, being able to specify a 'DKIM verified domain' will help serve scenarios where shared infrastructure provider services are used for sending emails. Since the DKIM domain is unique to each tenant and if it passes verification even when other authentication signals fail, if desired for legitimate business reasons, a spoofed message can still be allowed instead of being blocked.  <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/tenant-allow-block-list?view=o365-worldwide#domain-pair-syntax-for-spoofed-sender-entries-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list<br>GA date: July CY2022",
