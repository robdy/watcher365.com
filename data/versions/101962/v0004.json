  "description": "When creating a new standard channel, a new Notes tab will be automatically created. Each Teams team will have a dedicated OneNote workbook and each channel will have its own section, making it easier on the workgroup to add their notes. We will not be rolling out to GCC, GCC-High and DoD at this time and a new Roadmap item will be available for these environments shortly.",
