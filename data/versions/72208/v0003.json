    "newValue": "We are introducing Built-In Protection for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to automatically elevate all users within your organization to the base level of security protection. Built-In Protection will implement a low impact version of Safe Attachments and Safe Links, removing burden on admins to configure users with recommended security settings and policies. This new preset security policy will require no admin action and will be turned on by default for all new and existing customers. As a result, customers will be automatically protected from unintentional configuration gaps in their policies and experience overall improved protection against phish and malicious message delivery to end users.   <br>More info: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-office/mastering-configuration-in-defender-for-office-365-part-three/ba-p/2906990<br>GA date: December CY2021"
