  "title": "Outlook: Loop Components Read Support in Mail on Mobile",
  "description": "Loop components are live, interactive,\ncollaborative objects that you can embed in Teams chats and now also in Outlook\nemails. When you send a Loop component, everyone in the email can view it\ninline, see changes instantly, and easily make edits. That means you can\ncollaborate right inside an Outlook email message. Outlook mobile users will\nsee the active Loop component -- where changes made to the component across\nsupported apps sync instantly -- and then be able to tap on the component to\nedit it in the Microsoft 365 mobile app or if you are in Android in the Loop\nmobile app.   <br>More info: https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Foffice%2Fget-started-with-microsoft-loop-9f4d8d4f-dfc6-4518-9ef6-069408c21f0c&data=05%7C01%7Cv-cmerritt%40microsoft.com%7C36ca739e8580416954c308db4125b1fd%7C",
