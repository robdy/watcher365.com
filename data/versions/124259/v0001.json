Outlook mobile users will\nsee the active Loop component -- where changes made to the component across\nsupported apps sync instantly -- and then be able to tap on the component to\nedit it in the Microsoft 365 mobile app or if you are in Android in the Loop\nmobile app.   <br>More info: https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Foffice%2Fget-started-with-microsoft-loop-9f4d8d4f-dfc6-4518-9ef6-069408c21f0c&data=05%7C01%7Cv-cmerritt%40microsoft.com%7C36ca739e8580416954c308db4125b1fd%7C"
