  "description": ",With this feature, users can bring up the\nmeeting stage to the foreground by pressing their Teams Button during a\nmeeting. This allows users to more quickly return to the meeting stage to\nreview chat discussions or the content being shared, especially if the meeting\nstage was hidden behind other windows. Note: This feature only applies to\ndevices with dedicated Teams Buttons. If the device has a dual-purpose button\n(both hookswitch and Teams Button), pressing the button will end the call.",
