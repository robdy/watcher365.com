  "description": "We are adding markers (which appear as icons above the video timeline) in Teams meeting recording timelines to indicate when you joined or left a meeting. The markers are personalized, so that only you will see your join and leave marker. The markers help you jump right to part of a meeting that you may have missed. Markers will only show up on recordings of Teams meeting that you were invited to and that you joined. <br>GA date: July CY2022",
