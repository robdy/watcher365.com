  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Teams calendar now includes scheduling form pop-outs for GCC-High and DoD",
  "description": "Currently, it is not possible to work on a file, chat, look into activity while managing time on teams' calendar. The reason for this is all these are in different apps located in the left app tray. Users have to switch back and forth between these apps to multi-task in calendar and there are times the data/context gets lost while switching between these apps.  We have heard this feedback and as a first step towards solving this, scheduling form can now be popped out as a separate window. This scheduling form new window can be seen while creating a new meeting An existing meeting can also be now popped out by clicking on the icon on scheduling form.   Our tech wizards have also made some improvements to calendar in this version which makes it faster to load now. In our next versions, we also plan to pop out the complete calendar app as a new window.",
