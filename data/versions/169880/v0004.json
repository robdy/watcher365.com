  "description": ",With this update, Insider Risk\nManagement admins can add any SharePoint sites as priority content or exclude\ncertain SharePoint sites in Insider Risk Management policies by searching the\nsite names or using the exact URLs. Microsoft\nPurview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify\npotential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data\nleakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to\ncreate policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and\norganizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are\npseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in\nplace to help ensure user-level privacy.",
