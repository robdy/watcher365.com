  "description": "The Facilitator agent in Microsoft 365 takes real-time notes during your meetings, allowing everyone to co-author and collaborate seamlessly. This frees everyone up to focus and engage deeply in meetings. To enable real-time notes in meetings, users can toggle the  ‘AI-generated notes’ setting on when scheduling the meeting in the Teams calendar or toggle it on during the meeting through the Notes button in the toolbar. To access the real-time notes, select Notes in the toolbar to open the notes pane where everyone can see live notes being generated every few minutes as the conversation happens. The notes are organized by topics and follow-up tasks.",
