    "newValue": ",Many customers often consider shared documents or cloud attachments as a form of communication, and therefore are required to preserve and make that content discoverable. While end users benefit from quickly sharing files for visibility and collaboration, this practice has been challenging for eDiscovery and legal professionals. To help customers efficiently meet their regulatory obligations for discovery, eDiscovery (Premium) plans to support the ability to discover the version of the document at the time that it was shared. This helps ensure that the correct document information is available to eDiscovery processes. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/overview-ediscovery-20<br>GA date: April CY2023<br>Preview date: July CY2022"
