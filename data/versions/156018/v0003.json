  "description": "With this update, the maximum number of policies for each insider risk policy template increases from 5 to 20. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. Note: The clouds were incorrect and have now been changed to reflect the correct state. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.",
