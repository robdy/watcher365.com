  "description": "Video owners and editors will soon have the ability to upload multiple audio tracks in a single video when using Stream (on SharePoint). These audio tracks will act as alternates to the main audio track. Â This feature can be used to add multiple language audio tracks for multi-lingual organizations, or to add audio descriptive tracks or to add audio tracks for other purposes. Viewers of the video will be able to select which audio track they would like to hear by clicking the Audio Tracks button (headphones icon) in the video player.",
