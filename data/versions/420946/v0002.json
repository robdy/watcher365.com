  "description": "Currently, leaders are managed in Viva Engage manually. If you wish to add or remove leaders, you need to go to Engage to do so. This feature will allow you to define a group that includes users who should be designated as leaders. As you add or remove people from that group, they will gain or lose privileges accordingly. The manual method will continue to be available.",
