  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - Alert triage improvements â€“ user context during alert review",
  "description": "While reviewing an alert, analysts and investigators can quickly reference more user context details, such as the detected event and the activities that generated the alert. These additional details can provide context that may be relevant to determining if an alert should be escalated for further investigation. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
