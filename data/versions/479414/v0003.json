With this role, admins will have dedicated permissions to manage Viva Glint-related settings in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC), without requiring the elevated privileges of Global or User admin roles. This role is essential for users who need to: read and configure all settings of Viva Glint in MAC, assign Viva Glint service admins, and create or manage Azure support tickets.",
