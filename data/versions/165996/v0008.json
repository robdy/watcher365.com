  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - Enhancements to app and risky browsing activity evidence",
  "description": "<div><span style=\"\">This update provides two enhancements to app and risky browsing activities that may lead to a data security incident in forensic evidence. Admins with appropriate permissions will no longer need to enable browsing indicators from the insider risk settings page to gain visual insights of these activities. In addition, the feature has been updated with more precise detection when users switch between tabs and windows. This results in more reliable visual evidence insights when context is switched in the browser. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. Note: The roadmap item was inadvertently marked rolling out and has now been corrected. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.</span> </div>",
