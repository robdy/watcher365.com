  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal:  eDiscovery (Premium) - New predictive coding module",
  "description": "To help cull and reduce data, right where Microsoft 365 data is created, shared, and stored, legal practitioners can use our new predictive coding module without moving data outside the Microsoft Purview security and compliance boundary. As part of this preview release, legal practitioners can organize content for review faster by going through training rounds of relevant and non-relevant content to iteratively train and tune the model performance by starting with as little as 50 items. This is an improvement from traditional models that require customers to train upwards of 10 times more documents to get started and see the output of the model.  <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/overview-ediscovery-20?view=o365-worldwide",
