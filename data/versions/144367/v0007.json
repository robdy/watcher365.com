End users will be notified about chats from new contacts,\ngiving them a choice to accept or block the conversations. If conversations are\nblocked, all future messages from the sender will no longer be received.\nSenders can be unblocked at anytime by the users with these policies. This\nfeature is available with a Teams Premium add-on license.</span> </div><div> </div>",
