  "title": "Microsoft Viva: Topics in Teams Channels",
  "description": "Earlier this year, we rolled out new Viva Topics integrations with Microsoft Teams. To widen the reach of Topics into the areas team members work, Viva Topics will expand from chats in Teams to channels in Teams, allowing users to mention topics and see topic cards within a given channel.       This addition to the Teams integration will make the Topics experience more intuitive and approachable, allowing you to interact with topics in the spaces you are used to collaborating with team members. This item is no longer accurate and is being removed from the roadmap.  We apologize for any inconvenience.",
