  "description": "Document Fingerprinting in Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) converts a standard form into a sensitive information type (SIT), which you can use in the rules of your DLP policies. This update extends support for Fingerprint-based SITs to additional workloads, including SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, and Endpoint and enables admins to adjust threshold while creating Fingerprint SITs.\n\nThis also allows you to detect when a portion of your sensitive document is exposed using partial matching support with Fingerprinting across the compliance solutions.",
