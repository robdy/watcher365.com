  "description": "With so many of us in back-to-back meetings, it can be a real struggle to stay on top of pre-reads, action items, and even what each meeting is about. Copilot can identify and summarize the key points so you can show up prepared in just a few minutes. When you open an upcoming meeting that has a summary available, click on \"Prepare\" and get a detailed briefing of your meeting leveraging the power of the Microsoft Graph. Now you have all the most important details you need and can arrive prepared and ready to engage in a productive conversation. This feature will be available in the new Outlook for Windows and web. #newoutlookforwindows",
