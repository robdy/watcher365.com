  "description": "Outlook will help you compose emails more quickly and efficiently by allowing you to minimize your draft emails and quickly access them again from the message list or calendar view. This means that, while composing an email, you can easily get information you need from your calendar or other emails and easily get back into the draft you are working on without ever having to go to the Draft folder.",
