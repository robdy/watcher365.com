  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - File type exclusion in email attachments",
  "description": ",Admins can configure file type exclusions from Insider Risk Management policies, though by default these exclusions do not apply to email attachments. With this update, the file type exclusion will extend to email attachments to help reduce noisy signals. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
