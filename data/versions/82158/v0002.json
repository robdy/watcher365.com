  "description": "We are combining the best of Microsoft Teams templates with SharePoint site templates - into the same flow of creation. When we create a new team using a default template - for example the \"Manage a Project\" template, the project management channels and apps, and the connected SharePoint template gets applied automatically. Critically, the pages, lists, and Power Platform integrations are pinned as tabs in Teams automatically, and best of all these pages and lists are fully editable right in Teams.",
