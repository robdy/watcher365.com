  "title": "Microsoft Purview | Communication Compliance - Reduce detection to investigation time from 24 hours to 1 hour (U.S. Government clouds)",
  "description": "This feature will reduce the detection to investigation time to under an hour, allowing your organization to respond promptly to policy violations. The alert will be reviewed by a policy investigator, who is explicitly granted permission to review policy alerts by the Communication Compliance admin role. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance-investigate-remediate?view=o365-worldwide",
