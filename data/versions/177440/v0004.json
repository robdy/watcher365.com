  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Ending the Microsoft Purview legacy alerts ingestion into Microsoft 365 Defender portal",
  "description": ",To increase the relevance of DLP alerts and incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender portal, we are ending the flow of the following legacy alerts into Microsoft 365 Defender portal: eDiscovery Search started or exported, successful exact data match upload, retention auto-labeling policy simulation completed, unusual volume of DLP policy matches, failed exact data match upload, MIP autolabel simulation completed, unusual volume of external file sharing, and unusual volume of file deletion. These alerts were created as a result of legacy standalone alert policies. For a better experience, we recommend using the alerting toggle in the DLP policy authoring experience.",
