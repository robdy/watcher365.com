  "description": "Now available on mobile, Copilot in Teams responses have a citation number at the end of each Copilot statement that provides detail on the meeting artifact or source that Copilot used to generate the response, like the meeting transcript. Users can select the citation to see which speaker the citation is attributed to, the exact quote from the transcript, as well as the time stamp of the quote in the transcript. Selecting a reference number will open a transcript viewer that displays the source of the response.",
