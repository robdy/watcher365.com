The Content Explorer Export feature has a limitation of exporting data only after drill down to specific location. This update will allow admins to use a new cmdlet within Security & Compliance PowerShell, Export-ContentExplorerData, to export all rows of data for the content that are scanned and shown on the Content Explorer.",
