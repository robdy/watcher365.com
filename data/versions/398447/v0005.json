This release enables a parent/guardian to get access to their child’s profile in School Connection if they login to Teams (mobile) with their phone number and the school has registered that phone number as a parent/guardian contact. Additionally, a parent/guardian will easily get access to their child’s profile if the phone number or email address that is registered by the school is saved as a login information in their Microsoft account.
