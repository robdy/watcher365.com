These classifiers are built using large language models. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance?provides the tools to help?organizations detect business conduct and?regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are?opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy."
