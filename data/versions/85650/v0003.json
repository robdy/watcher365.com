    "newValue": ",Communication Compliance Day Zero Insights helps organizations discover trends that they may not be aware of, like harassment, threats or sharing of sensitive information. Insights for sensitive information types are surfaced automatically through the existing compliance portal data classification service while insights for machine learning classifiers require an organization to have already configured a policy in Communication Compliance. Insights for both sensitive information types and machine learning classifiers are designed to help organizations holistically set up parameters for internal governance by identifying potential areas of risk and determining the type and scope of communication policies to be configured. Day Zero Insights displays the aggregate number of matches per classification type, with none of the insights containing any personally identifiable information. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance helps organizations detect explicit code of conduct and regulatory compliance violations, such as harassing or threatening language, sharing of adult content, and inappropriate sharing of sensitive information. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are explicitly opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to ensure user-level privacy.<br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance?view=o365-worldwide<br>Preview date: November CY2021"
