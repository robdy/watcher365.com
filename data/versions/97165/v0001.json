  "description": "Grow your business by getting paid for appointments, classes, or events you host on Teams with the Payments app. Once you connect a third-party service to receive payments, you’ll be able to request payment right during a Teams meeting—and have customers pay you in just a few clicks. The Payments app is supported for businesses registered in the United States and Canada at this time. Note: Admins can manage the availability of the Payments app in the Teams admin center.  <br>GA date: December CY2022",
