    "oldValue": "Users will now be able to choose the live captions in the language they prefer, with the help of Microsoft Cognitive Service Speech Translation Capabilities. This will help users fully participate in meetings where the spoken language may not be their most comfortable language to use. Note: Live translated captions are available for a limited time as part of the preview release of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. Starting April 2023, this feature will only be available to Teams Premium users. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.",
    "newValue": "Starting April 2023, product terms require that live translation for meeting captions users be licensed with Teams Premium. While license enforcement won’t be implemented until July 1, 2023, we recommend that proper licenses be acquired for any user that you intend to benefit from live translation of meeting captions. To review the terms and conditions governing the use of Microsoft products and Professional Services acquired through Microsoft Licensing programs, see the?Product Terms."
