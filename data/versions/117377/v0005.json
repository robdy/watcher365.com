  "description": "Weâ€™re reducing clutter and creating an efficient canvas by surfacing the layout options in the web part toolbars. Previously, we mentioned we would be moving the \"add section\" feature to be inline on canvas. Based on the feedback we received, we are currently reconsidering the best way to design this user experience and will have a new update for you soon. For now, you can expect to still find the \"add section\" in the left toolbar.",
