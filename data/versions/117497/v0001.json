  "description": "Not all M365 documents are used in the same way. You’ll inevitably have a few that you use every week and some you’ll use occasionally. This is where using Favorites can help you stay organized.   Favoriting files is a great way to mark content of personal importance and can help you to get back to the content you're looking for right away. We have made sure that the favorites experience is consistent across Office.com, OneDrive, Document Libraries, and the Files app in Teams by building on top of the existing pinning and favorites experience in Office.<br>GA date: March CY2023",
