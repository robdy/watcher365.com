  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - Policy tuning analysis for priority content-only policies",
  "description": "Policy tuning analysis provides admins with a real-time prediction of the number of users in a tenant that could potentially match a given set of policy conditions. With this update, policy tuning analysis will support insider risk policies that are scoped for priority content. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
