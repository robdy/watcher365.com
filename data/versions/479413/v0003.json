  "description": "We are launching the SIP Ladder diagram tool in Teams Admin center to enable admins to troubleshoot their Direct Routing calls in a self-serve way. This feature will be available via the Usage reports page under Teams Admin center. It will also enable admins to view the SIP requests, responses and associated SDP data between Microsoft teams proxy and the SBC through which the call was routed. This data will be available for all calls made more than 30 minutes and less than 30 days ago.",
