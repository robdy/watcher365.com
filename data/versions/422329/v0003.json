  "description": "Communication Compliance introduces the ability to identify and flag potential workplace safety concerns in user-reported Teams messages. Investigators now have an extra indication to decide what risk exists in user-reported messages and can configure an Inappropriate Content policy to proactively identify similar inappropriate content moving forward.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
