  "description": "We are adding markers (which appear as icons above the video timeline) in Teams meeting recording timelines to indicate when your name was mentioned during the meeting. Â The markers are personalized, so that only you will see when your name was mentioned. The markers help you see who mentioned your name and in which context, and to easily jump right to that part of the meeting. This feature is only available for customers who have purchased the Microsoft Teams Premium add-on offering. <br>GA date: March CY2023",
