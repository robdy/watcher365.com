  "description": ",{We have made the decision to postpone rolling out to DoD organizations at this time. We will communicate via Roadmap and Message center when we are ready to proceed.} To reduce the number of stale raised hand in meetings, we will now suggest users to lower their raised hand. After we detect, they spoke in the meeting. They will be able to choose to keep their hand raised. If the user doesn’t take any action on the suggestion notification, will automatically lower their hand. This should ensure smoother meeting facilitation for organizers and presenters.",
