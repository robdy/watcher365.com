  "description": "This feature will equip administrators evaluating apps and\ncopilot extensions for deployment with extensive security and related certification data to help those admins more quickly evaluate that an app and/or extension complies with their tenant security requirements. Initially, the information provided will include results\nfrom individual M365 certification tests and evidence submitted by ISVs during\nMicrosoft's audit of their app or copilot extension. Additionally, for\nnon-certified apps, admins will receive details on data handling, security, and\ncompliance as self-attested by the ISV.",
