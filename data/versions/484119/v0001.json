  "description": "Real-Time Text (RTT) lets participants type in the meeting while othersâ€™ speech is transcribed in real time. Whether for accessibility reasons or simply a preference to chime in via text, RTT ensures seamless, instant communication for everyone. It enables effective collaboration for all users, including those who prefer typing over speaking, and can be especially useful in situations where speaking is difficult or not possible.",
