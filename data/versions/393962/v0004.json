  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Data Lifecycle Management - Enable associated SharePoint sites to be excluded from retention policies after deletion of Modern Group",
  "description": "If a modern M365 group is deleted, the associated SharePoint has a retention policy, a file with a retention label, or a legal hold, it remains active but orphaned. These sites cannot be excluded from the retention policy after the deletion of the group because of designed modern group scope. The site-level holds are applied when a group is added to a retention policy and the Tenant-level holds are applied when the complete modern group workload is added to a retention policy. Currently, to remove such a hold, the customer has to raise an escalation. With the rollout of this feature, users will be able to exclude the orphaned SPO site from both site-level holds and tenant-level holds as a self-service.",
