  "description": "<div><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,sans-serif;\">Microsoft Stream (on\nSharePoint) will soon introduce a video trimming feature which will allow users\nwith edit permissions to trim the start, end and any parts in the middle of a\nvideo.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>When you trim a video, Stream\nwonâ€™t change the original video file itself. Instead, it just hides the trimmed\nparts from your viewers.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>When you're\ndone trimming you can toggle to the preview mode to see the trimmed video just\nlike your viewers will see. When a video is trimmed the transcript and chapters\nwill be adjusted automatically to reflect only what is shown in the video.\nPeople with edit permission will be able to see full original content and edit\nor delete those trimmed parts. When available this feature can be accessed by\nopening a video in the Stream web app and taping the edit button.</span> </div>",
