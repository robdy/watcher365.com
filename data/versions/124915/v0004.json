  "description": "To scope service side auto-labeling for OneDrive locations, you must specify users or groups. Previously, you had to specify sites by URLs. Any existing OneDrive URL sites in auto-labeling policies will continue to work but before you can specify new OneDrive locations, or for restricted admins, you must first delete any existing site URLs. Groups supported: distribution groups, Microsoft 365 groups, mail-enabled security groups, and security groups.",
