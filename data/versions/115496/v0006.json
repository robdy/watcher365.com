  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - File archiving as obfuscation",
  "description": "Admins can configure policies and leverage sequence detection to detect file archiving actions taken by users that potentially obfuscate their data exfiltration activities. This can provide greater visibility into a series of connected activities that might be performed to evade detection of data exfiltration that could lead to a security incident. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
