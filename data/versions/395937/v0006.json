  "description": "Pull Print enables IT Pros to offer their end users a simplified view of the print solution.  Specifically, IT Pros can set up virtualized printer(s) per location or region so that end users only need to know the name of one printer. Those users can securely release their own print jobs at any printer at that location or region, depending on the setup.",
