  "description": "With this feature users can get an embed code for an audio or video file that is uploaded to or stored in SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, or Yammer. The embed code renders the audio or video source file in a player and can be used on intranets or internal websites. Note: If the user is logged into the internal site or intranet where the embedded player is featured, but is not logged into Microsoft 365, then they will be asked to login to Microsoft 365 to view the content. If the user does not have permission to view the content, then a modal will surface in place of the video which will allow the user to request access to the audio or video file.",
