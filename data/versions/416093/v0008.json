  "title": "Microsoft Edge: Elevating top settings and improving settings page navigability",
  "description": "To make finding browser settings more efficient, Microsoft Edge is introducing three navigation improvements to Edge Settings. We are making no changes to the functionality of any setting and all settings will remain on the same page as they are today but will be behind clickable sections. The first is introducing quick access to the most used actions on the landing page of Edge Settings. Second, each densely populated page—Privacy, search, and services; Appearance; Cookies and site permissions; System and performance—will feature quick access to its most used actions. Third, for these same pages, each section will now click-through to its respective sub-settings (similar to a table of contents).",
