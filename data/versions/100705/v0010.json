  "description": ",Virtual Appointment is a new Teams meeting type tailored for B2C meetings with people outside of your organization. When using the meeting type, guests will get a meeting invitation that includes important appointment details to make joining easy. They can join from any device—no need to install Teams—and experience a comfortable pre-appointment virtual waiting room until you're ready to begin.  This was incorrectly marked as complete on May 15th, 2023 and has been updated to the correct status of rolling out.  ",
