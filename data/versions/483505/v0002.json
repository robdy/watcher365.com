  "description": "The Work Feed experience, available on the New Tab Page (NTP) for Work Feed-eligible Commercial users with a Microsoft 365 subscription, will have changing and updated functionalities. These changes include renewed focus on productivity and M365 modules. Users will have an updated My Feed experience on the enterprise new tab page. Users will no longer be able to view content and activity from their network, and instead will experience quick access to recently used M365 documents, recent SharePoint sites, upcoming Outlook events, M365 apps, and To-Do tasks.  New tab page policies continue to be enforced and not impacted by this updated Work Feed experience.<br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-enterprise-ntp",
