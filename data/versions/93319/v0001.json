Â In Insider Risk Management, you can detect these activities with a sequence detection. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, security and policy violations, and more. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/insider-risk-management?view=o365-worldwide<br>GA date: June CY2022"
