At the printer they enter the PIN to release their print job, supporting sustainability goals by preventing the consumption of power, paper and toner, if the print job is not completed. This functionality is already supported on Windows 11. Supported printers can be found on the Microsoft docs under More info link.  <br>More info: https://aka.ms/upintegrations",
