To help organizations better visualize the growth of exfiltration over time, this new trend chart will show a userâ€™s cumulative data exfiltration activity as it relates to other key signals like resignation date. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance.
