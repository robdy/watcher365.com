  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - Visualization of cumulative exfiltration trends",
  "description": "When investigating an alert, admins can leverage the activity scatter plot to visualize a historical timeline of activity types, risk scores, and the sequence of events. To help organizations better visualize the growth of exfiltration over time, this new trend chart will show a userâ€™s cumulative data exfiltration activity as it relates to other key signals like resignation date. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
