  "title": "Microsoft Purview | Audit: Granular scoping with role-based access control (RBAC)",
  "description": "IT departments in large organizations are built in a way that some of the day-to-day tasks are delegated to specific people or roles in the organization following the industry standard of least privilege access. Admins have a need to delegate role-based permissions to users or analysts in a granular way. In some cases, this delegation is based on function, and in other cases it is based on geography or scope of work. In this release, Audit will provide role-based information with Audit search results through the UI.",
