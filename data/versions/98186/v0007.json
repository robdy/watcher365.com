  "title": "Microsoft Purview | Communication Compliance: Support for adaptive policy scopes",
  "description": "Adaptive policy scopes enable your organization to define user scopes for policies based on criteria such as geography, group, or other Azure Active Directory attributes. With adaptive policy scopes, policies are automatically updated to include users that match defined risk criteria rather than requiring admins to repeatedly update static lists of users to include in the policy scope. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC and FINRA obligations), such as inappropriate sharing of sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language and sharing of adult content. Communication Compliance enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
