  "description": "With this update, admins will have the ability to manage email notifications through the “Admin notifications” section of the insider risk settings. Admins will be able to control the types of emails they receive, including a daily notification for newly generated high-severity alerts, or weekly emails summarizing policies with unresolved warnings. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
