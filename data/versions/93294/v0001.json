    "newValue": "The Stream web app improves how you view and publish video and audio files that are uploaded to Teams, Yammer, OneDrive, and SharePoint. The app and player experience works seamlessly with Office.com and brings key features of Stream (classic) into SharePoint. You can easily prepare your video for publishing with a title and description right under the video, set the custom thumbnail, add chapters, generate a transcript, share videos, and even share your video at a specific time code. Office.com and Share links to video and audio files across Microsoft 365 will get this updated experience automatically replacing the previous player page. <br>GA date: August CY2022"
