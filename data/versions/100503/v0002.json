  "description": "Create Lookup columns in modern list user interface - no settings page required. This means you can program a list item (column) to 'lookup' another set of data of pre-populated, managed choices. We are pleased to expand the columns types that are now supported when 'looking up' from the other list: Boolean (Yes/No), choice, and multi choice - plus formatting.",
