  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - New Insider Risk Management reporting capabilities",
  "description": "Insider risk management is introducing one central location for all reports including analytics and user activity reports. Additional reports will also be available that will summarize trends in alerts generated and cases created. Sample reports include alerts generated over time, alerts actioned over time, alerts and cases generated by region and department, top triggering events of alerts generated, and average time to triage alerts and cases.\n\nThe ability to filter reports will also be introduced. \n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
