  "description": "Adaptive Protection will now be available in Government clouds. Adaptive Protection is a capability of Microsoft Purview that dynamically assigns appropriate Data Loss Prevention policies to users based on the risk levels analyzed by the machine learning models in Insider Risk Management. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
