  "description": "Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and GitHub. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies.  \n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
