  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Roaming bandwidth control for GCC-High and DoD",
  "description": "Admins will now be able to set a bandwidth control policy to\ndisable video calls when users are working in bandwidth constrained areas –\nthis protects the reliability of the connection, automatically just based on\nwhere the users are located.  Once users return to a location with better\nbandwidth, their video calling is restored. Initially two settings from the\nTeams Meeting Policy will be included - AllowIPVideo, and MediaBitRateKb.  <br>GA date: April CY2022",
