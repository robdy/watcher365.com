  "description": "Clipchamp allows authors and viewers alike to share a portion of a video without changing the original media. Using draggable handles on the playback timeline, a link containing the desired clip start and end is put on the clipboard for easy sharing. Opening this link will play only the specified clip, and viewers can easily pop out to view the full video if desired. This will allow users to share the most relevant portion of their content.",
