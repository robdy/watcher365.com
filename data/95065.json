As an expansion of suggested replies in chats, Teams uses AI to surface files when it detects in the conversation intent to share a file. Now, users will be able to respond to their chat message and attach a file in one click. Note: The Government clouds release has been delayed. Â We will notify you, via Message Center, when we know more. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",
