  "title": "Outlook: Outlook for the Web - RSVP User Experience Consistency Updates",
  "description": "The RSVP experience will appear more consistent across the various locations from which a user can RSVP within both mail and calendar. For most RSVP flows, a user will be presented with the option to email an organizer, send an optional message to the organizer, and respond yes/no/maybe to the invite. This is not new functionality, but will be presented earlier in the RSVP flow in some RSVP locations and will have a more consistent visual treatment across all RSVP locations.",
