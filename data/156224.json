  "description": "Priority user groups in Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management help admins with the right permissions define the users in your organization who need more sensitive risk scoring. With this update, organizations can also restrict review of activities related to the priority user groups to specific analysts or investigators. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
