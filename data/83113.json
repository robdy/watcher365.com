  "description": "With this in-product feature support, end users and admins will be able to add other groups as member of a Dynamic Microsoft 365 Group by using the memberOf property. In the preview, users will be able to create these GDM a.k.a nested groups from Azure Portal & Group Card and they can be accessed & used like any other Dynamic Microsoft 365 Group across apps like Teams, Outlook & SharePoint. Enhancements around deeper levels of nesting, increasing the number of memberOf groups in a tenant are also being worked on and will be eventually available for GA.",
