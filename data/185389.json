  "title": "Outlook: Stream videos can now be watched inline in Outlook",
  "description": "We’re introducing the ability to watch Stream videos inline in Outlook on the web and the new Outlook for Windows. Soon, if someone pastes a Stream video link in a supported Outlook app and sends it to you, you will be able to watch it directly in your inbox. The videos will play inline for recipients within the same organization, meaning you will not have to leave Outlook to watch the video. Recipients outside the organization, and those not using the new Outlook or web, will see a link to the video which they can watch in the Stream web app (depending on the organization’s file sharing settings). Note: We have updated the Release Phase to show the current state. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",
