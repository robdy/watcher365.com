  "description": "As you start typing in the search box, you will see suggested searches and results based on your previous activity in Microsoft 365 and based on content that's trending in your organization. Personal query history will show the queries you have previously used. These personal query suggestions are served from your personal search history. Personal query suggestions are a quick way to get back to results you've found before. You just need to remember the beginning of a query, after you've typed just a few characters the query is suggested for you. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/microsoft-search-us-government-environments",
