The feature also works with any videos stored in SharePoint or OneDrive for business that contain transcripts. To edit a transcript, you must have edit permission to the video. Transcript editing helps you improve the quality of your transcript by quickly correcting minor mistakes such as misinterpreted acronyms, names, or incorrect punctuation.  Changes in the transcript are also reflected in the closed captions. <br>GA date: September CY2022",
