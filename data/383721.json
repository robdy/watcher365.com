  "title": "Outlook: Updated work hours and location experience in the new Outlook for Windows and web",
  "description": "This update brings a new look with the daily peek: click on your work location icon at the top of your calendar to change your work location, view who else will be in the office, or receive suggestions to help optimize your work day. This feature will come to the new Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web. Your work location will reflect across Microsoft 365, such as in Teams and your profile card. You can also update your location from Teams which will stay in sync with Outlook. We are also introducing a new location type, out-of-office, which will automatically sync with your out-of-office calendar appointments. #newoutlookforwindows",
