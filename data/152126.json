  "description": ",Tracking and revocation provides admins and end-users greater control over local files. When an end-user protects their local file with an encrypted sensitivity label, they enable the tracking and revocation feature. With this feature, the file owner and admin of the organization can view user access attempts to the file and whether they were successful. If needed, the file owner or admin can revoke access to the file.",
