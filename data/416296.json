  "title": "Outlook: Checking feedback policy across all accounts",
  "description": "Currently, when we determine whether a user is entitled to submit feedback, we only look at the feedback policy for their primary (global) account. Going forward, we are going to make the feedback policy check more restrictive which is more secure. We'll be looking at feedback policies for all users' accounts and basing their eligibility off the most restrictive policy value found. For example, if any of the users' accounts have Feedback disabled by a policy, we won't show the Feedback button in the Help tab of the ribbon for any of their accounts. #newoutlookforwindows",
