  "title": "Microsoft Teams:  Simplified Notes pane in meetings",
  "description": "We’re updating the Notes pane in meetings to streamline the design and make key controls more clear. First, we’re renaming the header from ‘Meeting notes’ to ‘Notes’ to match the pane’s name in the meeting toolbar.  Second, the file-level controls like “Open in new window” and “Copy component” are combined into a single header at the top for simplicity. As part of the single header, the control to open the component in the Loop web app will be found in the ellipses menu in the top header and no longer in the Pages icon.",
