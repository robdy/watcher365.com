  "description": "With this new feature, an admin can choose whether they want to expire the Adaptive Protection insider risk level. Today, this expiration happens automatically, but you can now choose to keep the Adaptive Protection insider risk level for a user, even if their alert is dismissed or case is closed. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
