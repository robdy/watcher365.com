  "description": ",Microsoft Edge for Business on desktop and mobile aims to address the needs of both end users and IT Pros. It is designed to meet the needs of the evolving security landscape while empowering users to be more productive by enhancing focus. In addition to native enterprise controls that you're already familiar with in Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Edge for Business includes new visual elements, including an adjusted icon, and optional automatic switching between a personal browser window (activated by Microsoft account MSA login) and a work browser window (activated by Entra ID login). All users who sign into Edge using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) will automatically be transitioned to Microsoft Edge for Business as part of the release.   <br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business",
