  "title": "Universal Print: Secure release with QR code on Microsoft Office mobile app",
  "description": "Secure release prevents waste from unnecessary printing and maintains user privacy by holding their jobs until they show-up at the printer. Universal Print will allow secure release to be configured for any printer. Users can retrieve their print jobs by scanning a QR Code and using the Microsoft Office mobile app. Users need to be authenticated with their work or school account. QR code-based release will work with both Universal Print ready printers and printers using the Universal Print connector. We may add more secure release options in the future.",
