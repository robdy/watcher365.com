  "description": "With this update, Insider risk management will help admins identify risky AI usage. We are adding new detections of intentional and unintentional insider risk activity on generative AI apps that can pose a risk to an organization. Activities will include risky prompts containing sensitive info or risky intent and sensitive responses containing sensitive info or is generated from sensitive files or sites.  Coverage will span across Microsoft Copilots and 3P generative AI apps. These detections will also contribute to Adaptive Protection insider risk levels.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
