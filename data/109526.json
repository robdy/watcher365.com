  "description": "With the expanded view of the profile card, users will now be able to see a richer view of a person's profile, such as their contact data, custom properties, and their LinkedIn information. This expansion also enables the user to view richer organization chart information about the person they are interacting with, without leaving the context they are in.Â Note: The launch state was incorrect and has now been changed to reflect the correct state. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.",
