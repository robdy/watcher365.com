  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management – new sequence indicators",
  "description": "With this update, Insider Risk Management will provide new sequence indicators that start with activities on devices that may lead to a data security incident, including downgrading/removing file labels, archiving files, and downloading files from unallowed sites. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
