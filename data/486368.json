  "description": "With the new inline protection capability for Edge for Business, you can prevent data leakage across the various ways that users interact with sensitive data in the browser, including typing of text directly into a web application or generative AI prompt. Starting with some of the top consumer GenAI apps (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek), admins will be able to block typed prompts containing sensitive data.â€¯ The inline protection capability complements existing endpoint DLP controls for uploading or pasting sensitive content in the browser.",
