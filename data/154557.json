  "description": "Follow is a new meeting response (RSVP) option that goes beyond the traditional Accept, Tentative and Decline choices geared towards individuals with high meeting loads and conflicting meetings each day. Follow is the ideal RSVP option for meetings you can't attend but still want to stay engaged and receive info about. Other attendees will be able to see if you are following a meeting. This feature will be available in the new Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web. Note: This began rolling out in May and not April. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. #newoutlookforwindows",
