  "description": ",The Experience insights in the Microsoft 365 admin center offers admins consistent data across usage, feedback, Net Promoter Score, and Help articles consumption. Admins can use such data to increase user satisfaction by launching relevant trainings and awareness campaigns in the organization. This experience would be particularly valuable to those roles in the IT organization who are responsible for understanding and improving the user experience for Microsoft 365. Note: We apologize for stating that this has rolled out, when in fact it will not until December 2023.  We value your patience and appreciate your understanding.",
