  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Information Protection - Smart Alerts and Alert Spotlighting for admins",
  "description": ",Smart Alerts are Out of Box alerts/insights for admins that are system generated and surface the top risks the admins must triage as a priority. These are intelligent alerts that leverage various signals including previous alerts, rule matches, user activity across workloads and combine them within and across solutions to flag high risk detections to the admins. They are not dependent on policies and admins can benefit from these detections even if they don’t have policies in place.",
