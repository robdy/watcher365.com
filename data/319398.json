  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Limit Presenter Role Permissions",
  "description": "We are introducing a tenant configuration that admins can apply to limit user actions assigned to presenters in meetings. When enabled, presenters will no longer be able to control attendee mics and cameras, change the role of other participants, lower participants’ hands, and remove participants from the meeting. We want organizers to have control, flexibility, and structure in managing their meetings.",
