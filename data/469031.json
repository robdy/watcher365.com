  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: eDiscovery - EXPORT ENHANCEMENTS",
  "description": "With the export of data being one of the core fundamentals of the solution, Microsoft Purview eDiscovery team is excited to announce significant changes coming to the export feature along with the new user experience in purview.microsoft.com. Key changes with export enhancements: The biggest change being introduced is that with the new user experience for eDiscovery where Standard and Premium cases have unified structure, the export is also aligned for both the streams – thereby providing a singular experience to customers. The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. Additionally, customers will experience a faster export capability in the new portal driven through enhancements in backend architecture and optimized partition.",
