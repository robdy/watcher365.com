  "description": "Service side auto-labeling will show files to be labeled, files labeled (past 7 days), and files labeled (total) for turned on policies in SharePoint and OneDrive. Clicking on the auto-labeling policy will show files to be labeled and files labeled (total) broken down by the different sites. If a policy includes Exchange as a location, the number of emails that were labeled won't be displayed because labels are automatically applied as messages are sent.",
