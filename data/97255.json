  "description": "For a better hybrid meeting experience, Teams users on their Android phone can use a single tap to join a meeting on both their device and Microsoft Teams Room. Audio on their device will be automatically turned off to ensure echo doesn't happen. Furthermore, the landing experience on Android will be optimized for engagement activities to make it easier to raise hand or react, chat, see all participants, and more.   <br>GA date: August CY2022",
