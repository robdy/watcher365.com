For failures that cannot be eliminated completely, we want to make it more informative for admins to troubleshoot the issue. As a first step, the printer’s jobs page will be enhanced by adding more information about the job like size of the print payload, document name, time taken at each step, error code for failed jobs with links to corresponding help page.",
