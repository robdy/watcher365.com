  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management-New attributes and features for alert and case",
  "description": "With this update, Insider Risk Management will provide additional attributes for alerts and cases to make it easier to understand which alerts and cases should be prioritized. The additional attributes include details, such as the date the last activity was detected and the last working date of departing employees. In addition, admins with appropriate permissions can customize columns and save a preferred combination of filters and columns. \n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
