  "description": "Mesh event attendees can now see raised hands and reactions from attendees in other rooms during large, multi-room Mesh events. This creates a greater sense of audience feedback as a whole across all rooms in a Mesh event and increases total audience engagement.  Additionally, event hosts will now be able to move between all rooms in a multi-room Mesh event.",
