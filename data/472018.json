  "description": "This update will replace the current Feed experience in Viva Connections across desktop, mobile, and web platforms with a SharePoint News reader experience. This new experience will present SharePoint news from the organizational sites, boosted news, users' followed sites, frequent sites, and people they work with in an immersive reader experience. This will include a Copilot-powered news summary as well, available only in Teams for Windows desktop in this initial release. February 2025: We inadvertently changed the status to Rolling Out, but the correct status is Development. We apologize for the inconvenience.",
