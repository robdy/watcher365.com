  "title": "Microsoft Viva: New card for Viva Engage conversations in Viva Connections dashboard",
  "description": "We're excited to announce a new integration between Viva Engage and Viva Connectionsâ€”an Engage feed card in the Connections dashboard. Users will be able to view and interact with their Viva Engage feed conversations directly in Viva Connections through a new card in the dashboard. This is possible when the admins/operators add the Engage card into their tenant Viva Connections dashboard. Users can then click on the card to engage with their Viva Engage feed conversations directly in Viva Connections without being redirected out of the app.",
