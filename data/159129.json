  "description": "This feature will allow admins to designate which users in their Viva Engage network have the ability to create new storyline posts. It gives admins another option for how to support storyline in their network in addition to the current choice of enabling or disabling storyline for all users. This feature will not change who can reply or react to the storyline posts from those users who have been given storyline privileges. That is, all users with access to Viva Engage can reply and react to storyline posts.",
