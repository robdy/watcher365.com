  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Communication Compliance - Ability to exclude spam and bulk emails ",
  "description": "Communication compliance policies will filter out bulk emails such as newsletters to help customers triage policy matches more efficiently. This will be an option for all policies in Communication Compliance. New policies will have this filtering on by default, but admins will have the option to configure as well as remove the filtering.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Communication Compliance helps organizations detect explicit code of conduct and regulatory compliance violations, such as harassing or threatening language, sharing of adult content, and inappropriate sharing of sensitive information. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are explicitly opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
