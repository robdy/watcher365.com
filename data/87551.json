  "description": "Users will now be able to find the apps they use regularly more prominently via app flyouts, and just @mention their favorite bot to start using it seamlessly in a new chat/team. Users will not need to repeat installation of apps. One-time installation would ready the app for use for that user anywhere inside Teams.   <br>GA date: June CY2022",
