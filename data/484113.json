  "description": "When you are in meetings or calls, you will be able to pop out, drag, and resize live captions (including live translated captions), and real-time-text (RTT) from the main meeting window. This enables you to position the captions and RTT wherever you prefer on your screen, so you can easily focus on the meeting while viewing the incoming text in a position most comfortable for you.",
