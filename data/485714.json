  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Teams Button Support on Multiple Connected Peripheral Devices",
  "description": "You can now use the Teams button across peripheral devices without having to manually select a specific device in the Teams devices settings. This ensures a more seamless experience navigating across multiple certified for Microsoft Teams personal peripheral USB devices (with a wire or a dongle) connected to the same host device (such as your laptop). For example, you can use the Teams button on headset A to bring up the meeting pre-join screen, then use the Teams button on headset B to join the meeting, and then use the Teams button on your connected speakerphone to raise hand in the meeting, etc.",
