  "description": "Cross-Location Shifts empowers organizations by enabling their Frontline workers to access and select open shifts from multiple locations within a region. Managers benefit from a larger labor pool by opening shift availability across multiple locations: a worker from one store location may select a shift in any other store across their region. This feature is accessible both via desktop and mobile.",
