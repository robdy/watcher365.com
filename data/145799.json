  "description": "We will be introducing a feature on the Profile Card as a Highlight that tells users when key collaborators have taken some action on key documents when looking at their profile card. Each collaboration network is a cluster of people, text strings and Microsoft 365 items (key item: documents). The actions that you can see the users in this Collab Network take on these key documents are modify, comment, reply, mention, multiple modifications and shared to you. These updates are only visible to other users within the same Collaboration Network i.e. your close collaborators.",
