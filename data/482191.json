  "description": "If no room is booked for a meeting, this AI feature recommends rooms in the meeting chat an hour before start when two or more attendees are in the same building, making in-person collaboration easier. It considers location of participants, room availability, and capacity to find the best meeting space. You can reserve the suggested room with one click and update the invite for everyone. A Teams Premium license is required for the meeting organizer to enable this feature, which is available in Teams Mobile on iOS.",
