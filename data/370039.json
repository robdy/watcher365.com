New Sticky Notes is a new experience built on the foundation of OneNote that offers the same experience as existing Sticky Notes, while making it easier to capture screenshots, automatically add the source information to the notes, and more. Existing Microsoft Sticky Note users on Windows will gradually be transitioned to the new Sticky Notes app.",
