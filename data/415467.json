  "description": "Updates to the office Cloud Policy Service setting \"Turn off sharing recommendation\" will disable the ability for users to share folders with individual users. Currently, the policy blocked users' ability to update default and anonymous permission levels for shared folders. This functionality will remain and will not be changed. The current policy and how it works with calendar sharing will not be impacted by this change and will remain as implemented. #newoutlookforwindows",
