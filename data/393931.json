  "description": "Administrators using the Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center who manage Teams apps that work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App will be able to apply their changes across all three clients (Teams, Outlook and Microsoft 365 App). Before this update, changes made through the Integrated Apps section in the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these apps on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App; similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. With this change, management of these apps will be unified across Teams, Outlook and Microsoft 365 App.",
