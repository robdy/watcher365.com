  "description": "Walkie Talkie, a push-to-talk experience that enables clear and secure voice communication over the cloud, enables teams to communicate instantly on a channel. Through this new functionality, users can now pin up to 5 favorite channels on the walkie talkie home screen, enabling users to quickly switch between these preselected channels to listen to incoming transmission or initiate PTT transmissions.
