  "description": "Outlook for Windows native sensitivity labeling will support oversharing pop-up dialogue as AIP plug-in to warn, justify or block email being sent. Admins could use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to define the oversharing pop-up DLP rules to groups of users. If users have the configured DLP rule trigger when they click send, a warn/justify/block pop up message will show up to make sure customer complies with admin's security double check requirements.",
