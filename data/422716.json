  "description": "With Workplace Presence, you can discover coworkers who are in office nearby. Location will be automatically updated to “office” when we detect that an employee is on site, signaled by the connection of their laptop to a known peripheral, e.g. a known or company-managed monitor in a corporate office, or on a bookable desk. Users can enable/disable “Auto-update my location when detected in the office” via the Places settings menu in Teams.",
