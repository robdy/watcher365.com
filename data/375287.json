  "description": "This feature will allow users to add or remove reactions to specific points of a recorded video via Stream Web App and Embed. Viewers will be able to see how their colleagues feel about a video and show their support towards the video owner. These reactions will be present in the timeline to highlight the most important parts of the video and can be used for navigation. Also, owners of the video can see detailed analytics about when viewers are reacting to videos and have ability to disable the feature.  This feature was incorrectly updated to a status of rolling out upon preview availability.  We apologize for any inconvenience.",
