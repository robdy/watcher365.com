  "description": "Shared line appearance lets a user choose a\ndelegate to answer or handle calls on their behalf. We are launching a\nsimplified experience for users who have set up call delegation which will be\navailable on the Teams desktop app and Teams phone devices. The new UI will\nallow delegates to easily switch between the different delegator lines they\nmanage and view call history for the delegator’s line.\nDelegators will be able to view and join active calls handled by the delegate\nand grant delegates permission to join active calls.",
