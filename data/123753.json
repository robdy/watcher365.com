  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Call delegation feature enhancements",
  "description": "Shared line appearance lets a user choose a delegate to answer or handle calls on their behalf. We are launching a simplified experience for users who have set up call delegation which will be available on the Teams desktop app and Teams phone devices. The new UI will allow delegates to easily switch between the different delegator lines they manage and view call history for the delegator’s line. Delegators will be able to view and join active calls handled by the delegate and grant delegates permission to join active calls. Note: We are adjusting the roadmap release phase to reflect the current state. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.",
