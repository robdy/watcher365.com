  "description": "With Parent Connection, educators can see the roster of the parents and guardians for their students (info provided by School Data Sync) and initiate a Teams chat with them by a single\nclick. So now, instead of the twice-yearly parent-teacher conference or\nsporadic email, educators and guardians can provide more iterative\nupdates back and forth through Teams chat to help manage and track their student’s progress.",
