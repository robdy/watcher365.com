  "description": ",With this update, admins will be able to assign a case or alert to other admins, analysts, and investigators, making it easier for colleagues to know which alerts and cases are being worked on. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance.
