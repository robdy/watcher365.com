  "description": "With this enhancement, admins can now select sequences in data leak and data theft policies without the requirement to select underlying individual indicators. This will allow admins to create more targeted policies with improved alert signals. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
