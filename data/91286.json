  "description": "We are launching an out-of-the-box template that can be useful when meeting with external participants. The controlled-content meeting template has preset defaults for meeting options to provide tight controls over lobby bypass, who can present, allowing chat in lobby/in-meeting, and who can record. Note: The roadmap item was inadvertently marked In Dev. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.",
