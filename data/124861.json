  "description": "Enable admins to reduce signal noise by configuring SharePoint site URLs and keywords exclusions, so activities involving these sites, or file names and email subject lines containing certain keywords won’t generate alerts. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
