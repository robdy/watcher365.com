  "title": "Exchange: Microsoft multi-geo admin operation auditing",
  "description": "We are pleased to announce that Exchange Online Multi-Geo will be introducing a new feature release in early March, allowing admins to audit operations across all locations with the help of Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet and Microsoft Purview portal. Once the feature has been rolled out to tenants, users can begin testing it by using either Microsoft Purview portal or Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet(not Search-AdminAuditLog) to track admin operations. Please note that this feature is limited to admin operations only and does not include other types of audit logs. <br>GA date: March CY2023",
