  "title": "Microsoft Defender for Office 365: Differentiated protection for Priority accounts",
  "description": "We are introducing differentiated protection for Priority accounts, which will provide users tagged as Priority accounts with a higher level of protection. As part of this release, we are introducing a Context filter within Threat Explorer and the Threat Protection Status report through which you can search for emails where Priority account protection is involved. In addition, the Threat Detection Details tab on the Email Entity page will be updated to show the threats, corresponding detection details, and whether these detections were identified as part of Priority account protection.",
