  "title": "Excel: Expanded eligibility for Python in Excel",
  "description": "Python in Excel allows you to bring the capabilities of Python directly into the Excel grid. With this release, we are expanding the eligibility for Python in Excel to include users with Microsoft 365 commercial licenses that only have access to the Microsoft 365 online apps, such as Office 365 E1 or Microsoft 365 Business Basic. Previously, Python in Excel was exclusive to users with paid Microsoft 365 commercial licenses that provided access to the Microsoft 365 desktop apps, such as Office 365 E3 and E5 licenses. As a part of this feature, users with access to Excel will be able to add Python formulas directly into their workbooks without any installation required. These Python formulas will be run by Excel in a secure container on the Microsoft Cloud with enterprise-level security as a compliant Microsoft 365 connected experience.",
