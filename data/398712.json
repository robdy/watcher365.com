  "description": "Microsoft Purview provides a unified solution for managing data security, governance, compliance, and privacy across your organization's landscape. Specific Microsoft Purview built-in role groups are being extended with a new role to prepare for upcoming features and capabilities relevant to those role groups: Compliance Administrator, Organization Management, and Purview Administrators role groups. This change will not disrupt the current capabilities for these role groups; it will enable admins in these built-in groups to manage Purview resources within Purview administrative unit scopes in the future.",
