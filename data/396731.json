  "description": "This feature is an improvement on the Interactivity feature in Microsoft Stream, where users with edit access can add document and other links to Callouts at specific times in a video. The goal of the improvement is to make creating and editing of interactive videos easier and quicker for editors by suggesting resources to link based on their M365 user activity. If there are no relevant suggestions, this allows them to search for resources to make their videos interactive from within Microsoft Stream.",
