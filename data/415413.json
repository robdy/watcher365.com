  "description": "Question voting allows instance participants to upvote the most important questions and sort by highest votes or recent activity. This gives moderators the ability to derive insights from the audience about what topics they care the most about and address them. Additionally, for questions that might be outdated or irrelevant, moderators can move them to a separate feed to ensure that presenters can focus on providing the most value to attendees.",
