  "title": "Outlook: Show shared folders and mailboxes as accounts in the New Outlook for Windows",
  "description": "To enhance your experience in Outlook, weâ€™re introducing changes to how shared mailboxes and folders are displayed. Shared mailboxes and shared folders will now appear directly in your account list in the folder pane, alongside your primary account and other connected accounts. This improvement makes navigation more intuitive by treating shared resources as separate accounts, providing quick and organized access. As part of this update, we are removing the \"Shared With\" node from the folder pane. All shared resources will now be integrated directly into the accounts list for a cleaner and more consistent navigation experience. This update streamlines how shared resources are managed and accessed, helping you stay productive and focused. #newoutlookforwindows This feature will be merged with feature 375635.",
