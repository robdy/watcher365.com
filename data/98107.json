This can help you assess whether a service incident is impacting users in your organization.  The service health page will be updated to show metrics from relevant monitoring reports when you view the issue detail page.  This information will be shown beneath the \"User impact\" section, along with links to relevant monitoring charts.   Microsoft 365 monitoring is currently in preview and enabled for customers with 5,000 or more Microsoft 365 subscriptions licenses. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-monitoring?view=o365-worldwide<br>GA date: September CY2022",
