  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: eDiscovery - Quick Summarizations in eDiscovery",
  "description": "Introducing the \"Quick Summarization\" feature for eDiscovery in Purview Copilot—designed to streamline case management with an intuitive, at-a-glance overview. This new capability allows users to quickly access a comprehensive summary of eDiscovery cases, holds, and searches, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple tabs to assess status, statistics of completed actions, pending tasks, and ongoing jobs.\n\nThe \"Quick Summarization\" feature consolidates this information into a single, easy-to-understand summary. Additionally, similar summary views are available for both Search and Hold within the eDiscovery case. Powered by existing “contextual summary” skill, the system analyzes case/search/hold metadata and generates natural language summaries, providing users with a clear, actionable overview of key details in real-time.",
