  "description": "When single clicking on an empty time slot on the calendar surface, the quick compose pop-up will no longer be shown - instead, you will be able to create an appointment by typing directly in the time slot on the calendar grid, just as you can in classic Outlook for Windows. There will be no change to double click behavior, the full compose form will still open as it does today. #newoutlookforwindows",
