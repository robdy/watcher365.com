  "description": "Following the positive reception of the \"Made for Email\" News templates, we are rolling out a change that will make every news post you create \"Made for Email\" by default. Now, no matter how you create your new News Post, whether it is copying a previous post or using an existing template, you will have access to send that full distribution as an email.  With this change, authors will still have access to our full webpart library by selecting \"all\" webparts in the webpart picker but are defaulted into having additional sending functionality.",
