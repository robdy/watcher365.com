  "description": "We have improved user options for sharing a link for a Teams app or a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent in a chat. Links to apps and agents will have a new preview card with user ratings for users to consider before installing apps or agents in Teams and clear actions like Add (which installs the app or agent) and View detail. A Microsoft 365 Copilot license is not required to share Copilot agent links but may be required to install and use the agent.",
