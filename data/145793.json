  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insightful Policy Performance",
  "description": ",The Communication Compliance homepage provides two columns that offer a quick overview of policy performance: the first column shows the number of scanned parent items in real time, giving visibility into scanning progress; the second column keeps you informed about parent items that meet policy conditions, ensuring you stay updated on potential issues requiring attention and maintaining control over communication compliance. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
