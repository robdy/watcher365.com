  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Insider Risk Management - Administrative units support",
  "description": ",Administrative units allow admins with appropriate permissions to subdivide the organization into smaller units, and then assign specific admins or role groups that can manage only the members of those units. For example, German administrators can only create/manage policies for only German users, and German investigators can only investigate alerts and activities from only German users.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
