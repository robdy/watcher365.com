  "description": "Coming soon, you'll be able to require approval at the campaign level for all your Amplify publications. The require approval feature brings compliance, accountability, and workflows to Lightweight Approvals in Amplify. By enabling required approval for a campaign, stakeholders can ensure that all campaign content adheres to organizational standards and receive the necessary approval before publishing, thus minimizing risks and errors. \n\nYou can require approval at the campaign level so that all Amplify publications within the campaign go through the approval process before the content is published. This is an optional setting that a user can choose to apply to a campaign. By requiring approval, organizations can apply a significant level of quality and security to their content, ensuring every piece of content aligns perfectly with their standards and expectations before it is published.",
