  "description": "Communication Compliance policies now support detection of inappropriate sharing of the following sensitive information types: named entities (full names/physical addresses/medical terms), credentials (login credentials/passwords), and exact match data. These new sensitive information types will be accessible to designated administrators during policy configuration. Communication Compliance helps organizations detect explicit code of conduct and regulatory compliance violations, such as harassing or threatening language, sharing of adult content, and inappropriate sharing of sensitive information. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are explicitly opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
