  "title": "Microsoft Viva: Viva Engage - Copilot Adoption Community",
  "description": "We are introducing new capabilities in Engage that will help organizations with their M365 Copilot rollout and adoption journey by bringing together employees in a community of practice. This community will provide a place for employees to ask questions, seek support from both their peers and IT admins, share best practices, and learn more from articles and quick tips on how best to use Copilot. This templatized Copilot adoption community will take away much of the work from the community manager with a set-up checklist, suggested content, suggested members (based on Copilot license assignment), and other features like conversation starters and top Q&As to help with community member engagement.",
