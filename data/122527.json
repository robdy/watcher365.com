  "description": "Users think about which tasks they need to\ncomplete such as creating a survey inside Teams. Now, app suggestions will be\norganized by tasks the apps support as opposed to conventional categories\n(productivity, project management). As a result, the new categorization will\nreduce the amount of time users need to spend learning about these apps â€“ helping them to work more effectively. The task-based app\nsuggestions will be added to the Tabs, Messaging Extension, and Bots in-context\nStores.",
