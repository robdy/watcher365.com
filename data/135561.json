  "description": "In the Tasks app and Microsoft Planner, which\nhelps power the Tasks app in Teams, buckets are a common way to organize tasks\ninto different areas of work. The mobile experience for the Tasks app in Teams\nwill soon be updated to make it easier to filter to a specific bucket or set of\nbuckets, so you can focus on tasks in your area. We expect this simple user\nexperience change to provide greater focus and greater productivity, while\nmaintaining the familiar look and feel throughout the Tasks app.",
