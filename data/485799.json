  "description": "Admins now can set Intune policies via the Edge management service, alongside the existing cloud policies. This enables admins to deploy both browser policies in the cloud and Intune policies from a single pane, making it easy to keep users safe and the browser workflow streamlined. This feature comes along with a new policy creation wizard that will streamline the creation process into a comprehensive, step-by-step flow.",
