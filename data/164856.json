  "description": "With the help of AI topic extraction, we can\noffer suggested topics based on the user's question. Our AI topic extraction\nrecommends up to 3 topics to add to one's question based on what they wrote.\nThese can be existing Viva topics or newly generated ones that the user can\ncreate and add. The user still must select and add our AI suggested topic since\nthey do not automatically get attached to the question. The user can also still\nsearch and add their own topic and choose not to use our AI suggested topics.",
