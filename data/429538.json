  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Town hall concurrent attendee increase to 50,000",
  "description": "Organizers of town hall instances can now reach wider audiences in a single event with an expansion to a maximum of 50,000 simultaneous attendees. This increase serves as a significant jump from the previous attendee cap of 20,000 for organizers with a Teams Premium license. The quality and stability of town halls up to this new limit will remain constant, providing high-quality and reliable content to participants. For events with more than 20,000 concurrent attendees, some interactivity features are disabled for all attendees. Organizations can get support for audiences up to 50,000 concurrent attendees by reaching out to the Microsoft 365 Live Event Assistance Program (LEAP) for assistance (Microsoft 365 Live Event Assistance Program â€“ Microsoft Adoption). This feature is available for town hall organizers that have an active Teams Premium license.",
